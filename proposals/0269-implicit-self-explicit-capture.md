## Introduction

Modify the rule that all uses of `self` in escaping closures must be explicit by allowing for implicit uses of `self` in situations where the user has already made their intent explicit, or where strong reference cycles are otherwise unlikely to occur. There are two situations covered by this proposal. The first is when the user has explicitly captured `self` in the closure's capture list, so that the following would compile without error:

```swift
class Test {
    var x = 0
    func execute(_ work: @escaping () -> Void) {
        work()
    }
    func method() {
        execute { [self] in
            x += 1
        }
    }
}
```

Secondly, this proposal would make implicit `self` available in escaping closures when `self` is a value type, so that the following would become valid:

```swift
struct Test {
    var x = 0
    func execute(_ work: @escaping () -> Void) {
        work()
    }
    func method() {
        execute { 
            x += 1
        }
    }
}
```

## Motivation

In order to prevent users from inadvertently creating retain cycles, the Swift compiler today requires all uses of  `self` in escaping closures to be explicit. Attempting to reference a member `x` of `self` without the `self` keyword gives the error:

```
error: reference to property 'x' in closure requires explicit 'self.' to make capture semantics explicit
```

In codebases that choose to omit `self` where possible, this can result in a lot of unwanted noise, if many properties of `self` are used in a row:

```swift
execute {
    let foo = self.doFirstThing()
    performWork(with: self.bar)
    self.doSecondThing(with: foo)
    self.cleanup()
}
```

It also results in a lot of unnecessary repetition. The motivation for requiring explicit usage of `self` is to force the user to make the intent to capture `self` explicit, but that goal is accomplished after the first explicit usage of `self` and is not furthered by any of the subsequent usages.

In codebases that make heavy use of asynchronous code, such as clients of [PromiseKit](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit), or even Apple's new [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) and [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) libraries, maintainers must either choose to adopt style guides which require the use of explicit `self` in all cases, or else resign to the reality that explicit usage of `self` will appear inconsistently throughout the code. Given that Apple's preferred/recommended style is to omit `self` where possible (as evidenced by examples throughout [The Swift Programming Language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/) and the [SwiftUI Tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui)), having any asynchronous code littered with `self.` is a suboptimal state of affairs.

The error is also overly conservative—it will prevent the usage of implicit `self` even when it is very unlikely that the capture of `self` will somehow cause a reference cycle. With function builders in SwiftUI, the automatic resolution to the "make capture semantics explicit" error (and indeed, the fix-it that is currently supplied to the programmer) is just to slap a `self.` on wherever the compiler tells you to. While this likely fine when `self` is a value type, building this habit could cause users to ignore the error and apply the fix-it in cases where it is not in fact appropriate.

There are also cases that are just as (if not more) likely to cause reference cycles that the tool currently misses. Once such instance is discussed in **Future Directions** below. These false negatives are not addressed in this proposal, but improving the precision of this diagnostic will make the tool more powerful and less likely to be dismissed if (or when) new diagnostic cases are introduced.

## Proposed solution

First, allow the use of implicit `self` when it appears in the closure's capture list. The above code could then be written as:

```swift
execute { [self] in
    let foo = doFirstThing()
    performWork(with: bar)
    doSecondThing(with: foo)
    cleanup()
}
```

This change still forces code which captures `self` to be explicit about its intentions, but reduces the cost of that explicitness to a single declaration. With this change explicit capture of `self` would be one of *two* ways to get rid of the error, with the current method of adding `self.` to each property/method access (without adding `self` to the capture list) remaining as a viable option.

The compiler would also offer an additional fix-it when implicit `self` is used:

```swift
execute { // <- Fix-it: capture 'self' explicitly to enable implicit 'self' in this closure. Fix-it: insert '[self] in'
    let foo = doFirstThing()
    performWork(with: bar)
    doSecondThing(with: foo)
    cleanup()
}
```

Second, if `self` is a value type, we will not require any explicit usage of `self` (at the call/use site or in the capture list), so that if `self` were a `struct` or `enum` then the above could be written as simply:

```swift
execute {
    let foo = doFirstThing()
    performWork(with: bar)
    doSecondThing(with: foo)
    cleanup()
}
```

## Detailed design

Whenever `self` is declared explicitly in an escaping closure's capture list, or its type is a value type, any code inside that closure can use names which resolve to members of the enclosing type, without specifying `self.` explicitly. In nested closures, the *innermost* escaping closure must capture `self`, so the following code would be invalid:

```swift
execute { [self] in
    execute { // Fix-it: capture 'self' explicitly to enable implicit 'self' in this closure.
        x += 1 // Error: reference to property 'x' in closure requires explicit use of 'self' to make capture semantics explicit. Fix-it: reference 'self.' explicitly.
    }
}
```

This new behavior will also be available for closures with  `unowned(safe)` and `unowned(unsafe)` captures of `self` since the programmer has clearly declared their intent to capture `self` (as for strong captures). For `weak` captures of `self`, it's not immediately clear what bare reference to an instance property even *means* when the local `self` is bound weakly—should it be treated as though the programmer had written `self?.`? Should there be a special syntax available in this context, such as `?.x`? Should we offer a diagnostic offering to insert `self?.`? Or should we instead suggest that the programmer re-bind `self` strongly via a `guard` statement? There are enough open questions here that have not been sufficiently discussed, so this proposal leaves the handling of `weak self` captures as a future direction worthy of further consideration.

The existing errors and fix-its have their language updated accordingly to indicate that there are now multiple ways to resolve the error. In addition to the changes noted above, we will also have:

```
Error: call to method <method name> in closure requires explicit use of 'self' to make capture semantics explicit.
```

The new fix-it for explicitly capturing `self` will take slightly different forms depending on whether there is a capture list already present ("insert '`self, `'"), whether there are explicit parameters ("insert '`[self]`'"), and whether the user the user has already captured a variable with the name `self` (in which case the fix-it would not be offered). Since empty capture lists are allowed (`{ [] in ... }`), the fix-it will cover this case too.

This new rule would only apply when `self` is captured directly, and with the name `self`. This includes captures of the form `[self = self]` but would still not permit implicit `self` if the capture were `[y = self]`. In the unusual event that the user has captured another variable with the name `self` (e.g. `[self = "hello"]`), we will offer a note that this does not enable use of implicit `self` (in addition to the existing error attached to the attempted use of implicit `self`):

```swift
Note: variable other than 'self' captured here under the name 'self' does not enable implicit 'self'.
```

If the user has a capture of `weak self` already, we offer a special diagnostic note indicating that `weak` captures of `self` do not enable implicit `self`:

```swift
Note: weak capture of 'self' here does not enable implicit 'self'.
```

If either of the two above notes are present, we will not offer the usual fix-its for resolving this error, since the code inserted would be erroneous.

## Source compatibility

This proposal makes previously illegal syntax legal, and has no effect on source compatibility.

## Effect on ABI stability

This is an entirely frontend change and has no effect on ABI stability.

## Effect on API resilience

This is not an API-level change, and has no effect on API resilience.

## Future Directions

### Bound method references

While this proposal opens up implicit `self` in situations where we can be reasonably sure that we will not cause a reference cycle, there are other cases where implicit `self` is currently allowed that we may want to disallow in the future. One of these is allowing bound method references to be passed into escaping contexts without making it clear that such a reference captures `self`. For example:

```swift
class Test {
    var x = 0
    func execute(_ work: @escaping () -> Void) {
        work()
    }
    func method() {
        execute(inc) // self is captured, but no error!
        execute { inc() } // error
    }
    func inc() {
        x += 1
    }
}
```

This would help reduce the false negatives of the "make capture semantics explicit" error, making it more useful and hopefully catching reference cycles that the programmer was previously unaware of.

### Weak captures of `self`

It might be desirable to add improved diagnostic information (or similarly do away with the error) in the case where the programmer has explicitly captured `self`, but only as a weak reference. For the reasons noted in this proposal, this was not pursued, but answering the lingering questions and issuing a follow-up proposal would fit nicely with this direction.

## Alternatives considered

### Always require `self` in the capture list

The rule requiring the use of explicit `self` is helpful when the code base does not already require `self` to be used on all instance accesses. However, many code bases have linters or style guides that require `self` to be used explicitly always, making the capture semantics opaque. Always requiring `self` to be captured in the capture list explicitly would ensure that there are no `self` captures that the programmer is unaware of, even if they naturally use `self` for instance accesses. This would be a more drastic, source breaking change (and is not ruled out by adopting this change), so it was not seriously pursued as part of this proposal.

### Eliminate the former fix-it

A less extreme solution to the problem described above is to simply stop offering the current fix-it that suggests adding the explicit `self.` at the point of reference in favor of only recommending the explicit capture list fix-it, when possible.
