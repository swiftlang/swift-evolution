## Introduction

The types in the `UnsafeMutablePointer` family typically require manual management of memory allocations, including the management of their initialization state. Unfortunately, not every relevant type in the family has the necessary functionality to fully manage the initialization state of the memory it represents. The states involved are, after allocation:

1. Unbound and uninitialized (as returned from `UnsafeMutableRawPointer.allocate()`)
2. Bound to a type, and uninitialized (as returned from `UnsafeMutablePointer<T>.allocate()`)
3. Bound to a type, and initialized

Memory can be safely deallocated whenever it is uninitialized.

We intend to round out initialization functionality for every relevant member of that family: `UnsafeMutablePointer`, `UnsafeMutableRawPointer`, `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer`, `UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer`,  `Slice<UnsafeMutableBufferPointer>` and `Slice<UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer>`. The functionality will allow managing initialization state in a much greater variety of situations, including easier handling of partially-initialized buffers.

## Motivation

Memory allocated using `UnsafeMutablePointer`, `UnsafeMutableRawPointer`, `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer` and `UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer` is passed to the user in an uninitialized state. In the general case, such memory needs to be initialized before it is used in Swift. Memory can be "initialized" or "uninitialized". We hereafter refer to this as a memory region's "initialization state".

The methods of `UnsafeMutablePointer` that interact with initialization state are:

- `func initialize(to value: Pointee)`
- `func initialize(repeating repeatedValue: Pointee, count: Int)`
- `func initialize(from source: UnsafePointer<Pointee>, count: Int)`
- `func assign(repeating repeatedValue: Pointee, count: Int)`
- `func assign(from source: UnsafePointer<Pointee>, count: Int)`
- `func move() -> Pointee`
- `func moveInitialize(from source: UnsafeMutablePointer<Pointee>, count: Int)`
- `func moveAssign(from source: UnsafeMutablePointer<Pointee>, count: Int)`
- `func deinitialize(count: Int) -> UnsafeMutableRawPointer`

This is a fairly complete set.

- The `initialize` functions change the state of memory locations from uninitialized to initialized,
  then assign the corresponding value(s).
- The `assign` functions update the values stored at memory locations that have previously been initialized.
- `deinitialize` changes the state of a range of memory from initialized to uninitialized.
- The `move()` function deinitializes a memory location, then returns its current contents.
- The `move` prefix means that the `source` range of memory will be deinitialized after the function returns.

Unfortunately, `UnsafeMutablePointer` is the only one of the list of types listed in the introduction to allow full control of initialization state, and this means that complex use cases such as partial initialization of a buffer become needlessly difficult.

An example of partial initialization is the insertion of elements in the middle of a collection. This is one of the possible operations needed in an implementation of `RangeReplaceableCollection.replaceSubrange(_:with:)`. Given a `RangeReplaceableCollection` whose unique storage can be represented by a partially-initialized `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer`:

```swift
mutating func replaceSubrange<C>(_ subrange: Range<Index>, with newElements: C)
  where C: Collection, Element == C.Element {

  // obtain unique storage as UnsafeMutableBufferPointer
  let buffer: UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Element> = self.myUniqueStorage()
  let oldCount = self.count
  let growth = newElements.count - subrange.count
  let newCount = oldCount + growth
  if growth > 0 {
    assert(newCount < buffer.count)
    let oldTail = subrange.upperBound..<oldCount
    let newTail = subrange.upperBound+growth..<newCount
    let oldTailBase = buffer.baseAddress!.advanced(by: oldTail.lowerBound)
    let newTailBase = buffer.baseAddress!.advanced(by: newTail.lowerBound)
    newTailBase.moveInitialize(from: oldTailBase,
                               count: oldCount - subrange.upperBound)

    // Update still-initialized values in the original subrange
    var j = newElements.startIndex
    for i in subrange {
      buffer[i] = newElements[j]
      newElements.formIndex(after: &j)
    }
    // Initialize the remaining range
    for i in subrange.upperBound..<newTail.lowerBound {
      buffer.baseAddress!.advanced(by: i).initialize(to: newElements[j])
      newElements.formIndex(after: &j)
    }
    assert(newElements.distance(from: newElements.startIndex, to: j) == newElements.count)
  }
  ...
}
```

Here, we had to convert to `UnsafeMutablePointer` to use some of its API, as well as resort to element-by-element copying and initialization. With API enabling buffer operations on the slices of buffers, we could simplify things greatly:
```swift
mutating func replaceSubrange<C>(_ subrange: Range<Index>, with newElements: C)
  where C: Collection, Element == C.Element {

  // obtain unique storage as UnsafeMutableBufferPointer
  let buffer: UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Element> = self.myUniqueStorage()
  let oldCount = self.count
  let growth = newElements.count - subrange.count
  let newCount = oldCount + growth
  if growth > 0 {
    assert(newCount < buffer.count)
    let oldTail = subrange.upperBound..<count
    let newTail = subrange.upperBound+growth..<newCount
    var m = buffer[newTail].moveInitialize(fromContentsOf: buffer[oldTail])
    assert(m == newTail.upperBound)

    // Update still-initialized values in the original subrange
    m = buffer[subrange].update(fromContentsOf: newElements)
    // Initialize the remaining range
    m = buffer[m..<newTail.lowerBound].initialize(
      fromContentsOf: newElements.dropFirst(m - subrange.lowerBound)
    )
    assert(m == newTail.lowerBound)
  }
  ...
}
```
In addition to simplifying the implementation, the new methods have the advantage of having the same bounds-checking behaviour as `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer`, relieving the implementation from being required to do its own bounds checking.

This proposal aims to add API to control initialization state and improve multiple-element copies for `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer`, `UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer`,  `Slice<UnsafeMutableBufferPointer>` and `Slice<UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer>`.


## Proposed solution

Note: the pseudo-diffs presented in this section denotes added functions with `+++` and renamed functions with `---`. Unmarked functions are unchanged.

##### `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer`

We propose to modify `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer` as follows:

```swift
extension UnsafeMutableBufferPointer {
    func initialize(repeating repeatedValue: Element)
+++ func initialize<S>(from source: S) -> (unwritten: S.Iterator, index: Index) where S: Sequence, S.Element == Element
--- func initialize<S>(from source: S) -> (S.Iterator, Index) where S: Sequence, S.Element == Element
+++ func initialize<C>(fromContentsOf source: C) -> Index where C: Collection, C.Element == Element
--- func assign(repeating repeatedValue: Element)
+++ func update(repeating repeatedValue: Element)
+++ func update<S>(from source: S) -> (unwritten: S.Iterator, index: Index) where S: Sequence, S.Element == Element
+++ func update<C>(fromContentsOf source: C) -> Index where C: Collection, C.Element == Element
+++ func moveInitialize(fromContentsOf source: UnsafeMutableBufferPointer) -> Index
+++ func moveInitialize(fromContentsOf source: Slice<UnsafeMutableBufferPointer>) -> Index
+++ func moveUpdate(fromContentsOf source: Self) -> Index
+++ func moveUpdate(fromContentsOf source: Slice<Self>) -> Index
+++ func deinitialize() -> UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer

+++ func initializeElement(at index: Index, to value: Element)
+++ func moveElement(from index: Index) -> Element
+++ func deinitializeElement(at index: Index)
}
```

<!-- UMBP needs a method to initialize a specific element: rdar://51817146 -->

We would like to use the verb `update` instead of `assign`, in order to better communicate the intent of the API. It is currently a common programmer error to use one of the existing `assign` functions for uninitialized memory; using the verb `update` instead would express the precondition in the API name itself.

The methods that initialize or update from a `Collection` will have consistent (and strict) semantics, and require the destination buffer (or slice) to have enough storage to copy the entire source collection, and then return the index in the destination that follows the last element copied. The storage available precondition will be strictly enforced, resulting in a consistent behaviour. The existing `Sequence` functions intended such a precondition, but in practice cannot enforce it.

We also add functions to manipulate the initialization state for single elements of the buffer.  There is no `buffer.updateElement(at index: Index, to value: Element)`, because it can already be expressed as `buffer[index] = value`.

##### `UnsafeMutablePointer`

The proposed modifications to `UnsafeMutablePointer` are renamings:

```swift
extension UnsafeMutablePointer {
    func initialize(to value: Pointee)
    func initialize(repeating repeatedValue: Pointee, count: Int)
    func initialize(from source: UnsafePointer<Pointee>, count: Int)
--- func assign(repeating repeatedValue: Pointee, count: Int)
+++ func update(repeating repeatedValue: Pointee, count: Int)
--- func assign(from source: UnsafePointer<Pointee>, count: Int)
+++ func update(from source: UnsafePointer<Pointee>, count: Int)
    func move() -> Pointee
    func moveInitialize(from source: UnsafeMutablePointer, count: Int)
--- func moveAssign(from source: UnsafeMutablePointer, count: Int)
+++ func moveUpdate(from source: UnsafeMutablePointer, count: Int)
    func deinitialize(count: Int) -> UnsafeMutableRawPointer
}
```

The motivation for these renamings are explained above.

##### `UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer`

We propose to add new functions to initialize memory referenced by `UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer` instances.

```swift
extension UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer {
    func initializeMemory<T>(
      as type: T.Type, repeating repeatedValue: T
    ) -> UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<T>

    func initializeMemory<S>(
      as type: S.Element.Type, from source: S
    ) -> (unwritten: S.Iterator, initialized: UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<S.Element>) where S: Sequence

+++ func initializeMemory<C>(
      as type: C.Element.Type, fromContentsOf source: C
    ) -> UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<C.Element> where C: Collection

+++ func moveInitializeMemory<T>(
      as type: T.Type, fromContentsOf source: UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<T>
    ) -> UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<T>

+++ func moveInitializeMemory<T>(
      as type: T.Type, fromContentsOf source: Slice<UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<T>>
    ) -> UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<T>
}
```

The first addition will initialize raw memory from a `Collection` and have similar behaviour as `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer.initialize(fromContentsOf:)`, described above. The other two initialize raw memory by moving data from another range of memory, leaving that other range of memory deinitialized.

##### `UnsafeMutableRawPointer`

```swift
extension UnsafeMutableRawPointer {
+++ func initializeMemory<T>(as type: T.Type, to value: T) -> UnsafeMutablePointer<T>

    func initializeMemory<T>(
      as type: T.Type, repeating repeatedValue: T, count: Int
    ) -> UnsafeMutablePointer<T>

    func initializeMemory<T>(
      as type: T.Type, from source: UnsafePointer<T>, count: Int
    ) -> UnsafeMutablePointer<T>

    func moveInitializeMemory<T>(
      as type: T.Type, from source: UnsafeMutablePointer<T>, count: Int
    ) -> UnsafeMutablePointer<T>
}
```

The addition here initializes a single value.

##### Slices of `BufferPointer`

We propose to extend slices of `Unsafe[Mutable][Raw]BufferPointer` with all the `BufferPointer`-specific methods of their `Base`. The following declarations detail the additions, which are all intended to behave exactly as the functions on the base BufferPointer types:

```swift
extension Slice<UnsafeBufferPointer<T>> {
  func withMemoryRebound<T, Result>(
    to type: T.Type,
    _ body: (UnsafeBufferPointer<T>) throws -> Result
  ) rethrows -> Result
}
```

```swift
extension Slice<UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<T>> {
  func initialize(repeating repeatedValue: Element)

  func initialize<S: Sequence>(from source: S) -> (unwritten: S.Iterator, index: Index)
    where S.Element == Element

  func initialize<C: Collection>(fromContentsOf source: C) -> Index
    where C.Element == Element

  func update(repeating repeatedValue: Element)

  func update<S: Sequence>(
    from source: S
  ) -> (unwritten: S.Iterator, index: Index) where S.Element == Element

  func update<C: Collection>(
    fromContentsOf source: C
  ) -> Index where C.Element == Element

  func moveInitialize(fromContentsOf source: UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Element>) -> Index
  func moveInitialize(fromContentsOf source: Slice<UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Element>>) -> Index
  func moveUpdate(fromContentsOf source: UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Element>) -> Index
  func moveUpdate(fromContentsOf source: Slice<UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Element>>) -> Index

  func deinitialize() -> UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer

  func initializeElement(at index: Index, to value: Element)
  func moveElement(at index: Index) -> Element
  func deinitializeElement(at index: Index)

  func withMemoryRebound<T, Result>(
    to type: T.Type,
    _ body: (UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<T>) throws -> Result
    ) rethrows -> Result
}
```

Slices of `Unsafe[Mutable]RawBufferPointer` will add memory binding functions, memory initialization functions, and variants of `load`, `loadUnaligned` and `storeBytes`.
```swift
extension Slice<UnsafeRawBufferPointer> {
  func bindMemory<T>(to type: T.Type) -> UnsafeBufferPointer<T>
  func assumingMemoryBound<T>(to type: T.Type) -> UnsafeBufferPointer<T>

  func withMemoryRebound<T, Result>(
    to type: T.Type, _ body: (UnsafeBufferPointer<T>) throws -> Result
  ) rethrows -> Result

  func load<T>(fromByteOffset offset: Int = 0, as type: T.Type) -> T
  func loadUnaligned<T>(fromByteOffset offset: Int = 0, as type: T.Type) -> T
}
```

```swift
extension Slice<UnsafeMutableRawBufferPointer> {
  func copyMemory(from source: UnsafeRawBufferPointer)
  func copyBytes<C: Collection>(from source: C) where C.Element == UInt8

  func initializeMemory<T>(
    as type: T.Type, repeating repeatedValue: T
  ) -> UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<T>

  func initializeMemory<S: Sequence>(
    as type: S.Element.Type, from source: S
  ) -> (unwritten: S.Iterator, initialized: UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<S.Element>)

  func initializeMemory<C: Collection>(
    as type: C.Element.Type, fromContentsOf source: C
  ) -> UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<C.Element>

  func moveInitializeMemory<T>(
    as type: T.Type, fromContentsOf source: UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<T>
  ) -> UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<T>

  func moveInitializeMemory<T>(
    as type: T.Type, fromContentsOf source: Slice<UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<T>>
  ) -> UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<T>

  func bindMemory<T>(to type: T.Type) -> UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<T>
  func assumingMemoryBound<T>(to type: T.Type) -> UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<T>

  func withMemoryRebound<T, Result>(
    to type: T.Type,
    _ body: (UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<T>) throws -> Result
  ) rethrows -> Result

  func load<T>(fromByteOffset offset: Int = 0, as type: T.Type) -> T
  func loadUnaligned<T>(fromByteOffset offset: Int = 0, as type: T.Type) -> T
  func storeBytes<T>(of value: T, toByteOffset offset: Int = 0, as type: T.Type)
}
```

```swift
extension UnsafeMutablePointer {

For `Slice` of typed buffers, the functions need to add an additional generic parameter, which is immediately restricted in the `where` clause. This is necessary because "parameterized extensions" are not yet a Swift feature. Eventually, these functions should be able to have exactly the same generic signatures as the counterpart function on their `UnsafeBufferPointer`-family base. This change will be neither source-breaking nor ABI-breaking.

## Source compatibility

This proposal consists mostly of additions, which are by definition source compatible.

The proposal includes the renaming of four existing functions from `assign` to `update`. The existing function names would be deprecated, producing a warning. A fixit will support an easy transition to the renamed versions of these functions.

The proposal also includes the addition of labels to the tuple return value of one function. This is technically source breaking. We have tested the change against the source compatibility suite and found no issue.

## Effect on ABI stability

The functions proposed here are generally small wrappers around existing functionality. They are implemented as `@_alwaysEmitIntoClient` functions, which means they have no ABI impact.

The renamed functions can reuse the existing symbol, while the deprecated functions can forward using an `@_alwaysEmitIntoClient` stub to support the functionality under its previous name. The renamings would therefore have no ABI impact.

In the case of the added tuple labels, we can avoid an ABI impact by reusing the mangled symbol of the previously-existing function that had an unlabeled return tuple type.

## Effect on API resilience

All functionality implemented as `@_alwaysEmitIntoClient` will back-deploy. Renamed functions that reuse a previous symbol will also back-deploy.


## Alternatives considered

##### Single element update functions

An earlier version of this proposal included single-element update functions, `UnsafeMutablePointer.update(to:)` and `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer.updateElement(at:to:)`. These are synonyms for the setters of `UnsafeMutablePointer.pointee` and `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer.subscript(_ i: Index)`, respectively. They were intended to improve the documentation for that operation, in particular the  often overlooked initialization requirement.

##### Renaming `assign` to `update`

The renaming of `assign` to `update` could be omitted entirely, although we believe the word "update" communicates the API's intent much better than does the word "assign". In _The Swift Programming Language_ (_TSPL_,) the `=` symbol is named "the assignment operator", and its function is described as to either "initialize" or "update" a value. The current name (`assign`) seemingly conflates the two roles of `=` as described in *TSPL*, while the proposed name (`update`) builds on _TSPL_.

There are only four current symbols to be renamed by this proposal, and their replacements are easily migrated by a fixit. For context, this renaming would change only 6 lines of code in the standard library, outside of the function definitions. If the renaming is omitted, the four new functions proposed in the family should use the name `assign` as well. The two single-element versions would be `assign(_ value:)` and `assignElement(at:_ value:)`.

##### Element-by-element copies from `Collection` inputs

The initialization and updating functions that copy from `Collection` inputs use the argument label `fromContentsOf`. This is a different label than used by the pre-existing functions that copy from `Sequence` inputs. We could use the same argument label (`from`) as with the `Sequence` inputs, but that would mean that we must return the `Iterator` for the `Collection` versions, and that is not necessarily desirable, especially if a particular `Iterator` cannot be copied cheaply. If we used the same argument label (`from`) and did not return `Iterator`, then the `Sequence` and `Collection` versions of the `initialize(from:)` would be overloaded by their return type, and that would be source-breaking:
an existing use of the current function that doesn't destructure the returned tuple on assignment could now pick up the `Collection` overload, which would have a return value incompatible with the subsequent code which assumes that the return value is of type `(Iterator, Index)`.

##### Returned tuple labels

One of the pre-existing returned tuples does not have element labels, and the original version of the proposal did not change that. New labels are now proposed for this case. This is technically source-breaking, in that if existing source uses exactly the proposed labels in a different position, then the returned tuple value would be shuffled. The chosen labels have sufficiently pointed names that the risk is very small.

[Dianna Ma](https://github.com/tayloraswift) (aka [Taylor Swift](https://forums.swift.org/u/taylorswift/summary))'s initial versions of the pitch that became SE-0184 included more functions to manipulate initialization state. These were deferred, but much of the deferred functionality has not been pitched again until now.
