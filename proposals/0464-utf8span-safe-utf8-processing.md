## Introduction

We introduce `UTF8Span` for efficient and safe Unicode processing over contiguous storage. `UTF8Span` is a memory safe non-escapable type [similar to `Span`](0447-span-access-shared-contiguous-storage.md).

Native `String`s are stored as validly-encoded UTF-8 bytes in an internal contiguous memory buffer. The standard library implements `String`'s API as internal methods which operate on top of this buffer, taking advantage of the validly-encoded invariant and specialized Unicode knowledge. We propose making this UTF-8 buffer and its methods public as API for more advanced libraries and developers.

## Motivation

Currently, if a developer wants to do `String`-like processing over UTF-8 bytes, they have to make an instance of `String`, which allocates a native storage class, copies all the bytes, and is reference counted. The developer would then need to operate within the new `String`'s views and map between `String.Index` and byte offsets in the original buffer.

For example, if these bytes were part of a data structure, the developer would need to decide to either cache such a new `String` instance or recreate it on the fly. Caching more than doubles the size and adds caching complexity. Recreating it on the fly adds a linear time factor and class instance allocation/deallocation and potentially reference counting.

Furthermore, `String` may not be available on tightly constrained platforms, such as those that cannot support allocations. Both `String` and `UTF8Span` have some API that require Unicode data tables and that might not be available on embedded (String via its conformance to `Comparable` and `Collection` depend on these data tables while `UTF8Span` has a couple of methods that will be unavailable).

### UTF-8 validity and efficiency

UTF-8 validation is a particularly common concern and the subject of a fair amount of [research](https://lemire.me/blog/2020/10/20/ridiculously-fast-unicode-utf-8-validation/). Once an input is known to be validly encoded UTF-8, subsequent operations such as decoding, grapheme breaking, comparison, etc., can be implemented much more efficiently under this assumption of validity. Swift's `String` type's native storage is guaranteed-valid-UTF8 for this reason.

Failure to guarantee UTF-8 encoding validity creates security and safety concerns. With invalidly-encoded contents, memory safety would become more nuanced. An ill-formed leading byte can dictate a scalar length that is longer than the memory buffer. The buffer may have bounds associated with it, which differs from the bounds dictated by its contents.

Additionally, a particular scalar value in valid UTF-8 has only one encoding, but invalid UTF-8 could have the same value encoded as an [overlong encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Overlong_encodings), which would compromise code that checks for the presence of a scalar value by looking at the encoded bytes (or that does a byte-wise comparison).


## Proposed solution

We propose a non-escapable `UTF8Span` which exposes `String` functionality for validly-encoded UTF-8 code units in contiguous memory. We also propose rich API describing the kind and location of encoding errors.

## Detailed design

`UTF8Span` is a borrowed view into contiguous memory containing validly-encoded UTF-8 code units.

```swift
public struct UTF8Span: Copyable, ~Escapable, BitwiseCopyable {}
```

`UTF8Span` is a trivial struct and is 2 words in size on 64-bit platforms.

### UTF-8 validation

We propose new API for identifying where and what kind of encoding errors are present in UTF-8 content.

```swift
extension Unicode.UTF8 {
  /**

   The kind and location of a UTF-8 encoding error.

   Valid UTF-8 is represented by this table:

   ╔════════════════════╦════════╦════════╦════════╦════════╗
   ║    Scalar value    ║ Byte 0 ║ Byte 1 ║ Byte 2 ║ Byte 3 ║

   ╚════════════════════╩════════╩════════╩════════╩════════╝

   ### Classifying errors

   An *unexpected continuation* is when a continuation byte (`10xxxxxx`) occurs
   in a position that should be the start of a new scalar value. Unexpected
   continuations can often occur when the input contains arbitrary data
   instead of textual content. An unexpected continuation at the start of
   input might mean that the input was not correctly sliced along scalar
   boundaries or that it does not contain UTF-8.

   A *truncated scalar* is a multi-byte sequence that is the start of a valid
   multi-byte scalar but is cut off before ending correctly. A truncated
   scalar at the end of the input might mean that only part of the entire
   input was received.

   A *surrogate code point* (`U+D800..U+DFFF`) is invalid UTF-8. Surrogate
   code points are used by UTF-16 to encode scalars in the supplementary
   planes. Their presence may mean the input was encoded in a different 8-bit
   encoding, such as CESU-8, WTF-8, or Java's Modified UTF-8.

   An *invalid non-surrogate code point* is any code point higher than
   `U+10FFFF`. This can often occur when the input is arbitrary data instead
   of textual content.

   An *overlong encoding* occurs when a scalar value that could have been
   encoded using fewer bytes is encoded in a longer byte sequence. Overlong
   encodings are invalid UTF-8 and can lead to security issues if not
   correctly detected:

   - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2008-2938
   - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2000-0884

   An overlong encoding of `NUL`, `0xC0 0x80`, is used in Java's Modified
   UTF-8 but is invalid UTF-8. Overlong encoding errors often catch attempts
   to bypass security measures.

   ### Reporting the range of the error

   The range of the error reported follows the *Maximal subpart of an
   ill-formed subsequence* algorithm in which each error is either one byte
   long or ends before the first byte that is disallowed. See "U+FFFD
   Substitution of Maximal Subparts" in the Unicode Standard. Unicode started
   recommending this algorithm in version 6 and is adopted by the W3C.

   The maximal subpart algorithm will produce a single multi-byte range for a
   truncated scalar (a multi-byte sequence that is the start of a valid
   multi-byte scalar but is cut off before ending correctly). For all other
   errors (including overlong encodings, surrogates, and invalid code
   points), it will produce an error per byte.

   Since overlong encodings, surrogates, and invalid code points are erroneous
   by the second byte (at the latest), the above definition produces the same
   ranges as defining such a sequence as a truncated scalar error followed by
   unexpected continuation byte errors. The more semantically-rich
   classification is reported.

   For example, a surrogate count point sequence `ED A0 80` will be reported
   as three `.surrogateCodePointByte` errors rather than a `.truncatedScalar`
   followed by two `.unexpectedContinuationByte` errors.

   Other commonly reported error ranges can be constructed from this result.
   For example, PEP 383's error-per-byte can be constructed by mapping over
   the reported range. Similarly, constructing a single error for the longest
   invalid byte range can be constructed by joining adjacent error ranges.

### Creation and validation

`UTF8Span` is validated at initialization time and encoding errors are diagnosed and thrown.


```swift

extension UTF8Span {
  /// Creates a UTF8Span containing `codeUnits`. Validates that the input is
  /// valid UTF-8, otherwise throws an error.
  ///
  /// The resulting UTF8Span has the same lifetime constraints as `codeUnits`.
  public init(validating codeUnits: Span<UInt8>) throws(UTF8.EncodingError)
}
```

### Scalar processing

We propose a `UTF8Span.UnicodeScalarIterator` type that can do scalar processing forwards and backwards. Note that `UnicodeScalarIterator` itself is non-escapable, and thus cannot conform to `IteratorProtocol`, etc.

```swift
extension UTF8Span {
  /// Returns an iterator that will decode the code units into 
  /// `Unicode.Scalar`s.
  ///
  /// The resulting iterator has the same lifetime constraints as `self`.
  public func makeUnicodeScalarIterator() -> UnicodeScalarIterator

  /// Iterate the `Unicode.Scalar`s contents of a `UTF8Span`.
  public struct UnicodeScalarIterator: ~Escapable {
    public let codeUnits: UTF8Span

    /// The byte offset of the start of the next scalar. This is
    /// always scalar-aligned.
    public var currentCodeUnitOffset: Int { get private(set) }

    public init(_ codeUnits: UTF8Span)

    /// Decode and return the scalar starting at `currentCodeUnitOffset`.
    /// After the function returns, `currentCodeUnitOffset` holds the
    /// position at the end of the returned scalar, which is also the start
    /// of the next scalar.
    ///
    /// Returns `nil` if at the end of the `UTF8Span`.
    public mutating func next() -> Unicode.Scalar?

    /// Decode and return the scalar ending at `currentCodeUnitOffset`. After
    /// the function returns, `currentCodeUnitOffset` holds the position at
    /// the start of the returned scalar, which is also the end of the
    /// previous scalar.
    ///
    /// Returns `nil` if at the start of the `UTF8Span`.
    public mutating func previous() -> Unicode.Scalar?

    /// Advance `codeUnitOffset` to the end of the current scalar, without
    /// decoding it.
    ///
    /// Returns the number of `Unicode.Scalar`s skipped over, which can be 0
    /// if at the end of the UTF8Span.
    public mutating func skipForward() -> Int

    /// Advance `codeUnitOffset` to the end of `n` scalars, without decoding
    /// them.
    ///
    /// Returns the number of `Unicode.Scalar`s skipped over, which can be
    /// fewer than `n` if at the end of the UTF8Span.
    public mutating func skipForward(by n: Int) -> Int

    /// Move `codeUnitOffset` to the start of the previous scalar, without
    /// decoding it.
    ///
    /// Returns the number of `Unicode.Scalar`s skipped over, which can be 0
    /// if at the start of the UTF8Span.
    public mutating func skipBack() -> Int

    /// Move `codeUnitOffset` to the start of the previous `n` scalars,
    /// without decoding them.
    ///
    /// Returns the number of `Unicode.Scalar`s skipped over, which can be
    /// fewer than `n` if at the start of the UTF8Span.
    public mutating func skipBack(by n: Int) -> Int

    /// Reset to the nearest scalar-aligned code unit offset `<= i`.
    public mutating func reset(roundingBackwardsFrom i: Int)

    /// Reset to the nearest scalar-aligned code unit offset `>= i`.
    public mutating func reset(roundingForwardsFrom i: Int)

    /// Reset this iterator to code unit offset `i`, skipping _all_ safety
    /// checks (including bounds checks).
    ///
    /// Note: This is only for very specific, low-level use cases. If
    /// `codeUnitOffset` is not properly scalar-aligned, this function can
    /// result in undefined behavior when, e.g., `next()` is called.
    ///
    /// For example, this could be used by a regex engine to backtrack to a
    /// known-valid previous position.
    ///
    public mutating func reset(uncheckedAssumingAlignedTo i: Int)

    /// Returns the UTF8Span containing all the content up to the iterator's
    /// current position.
    ///
    /// The resultant `UTF8Span` has the same lifetime constraints as `self`.
    public func prefix() -> UTF8Span

    /// Returns the UTF8Span containing all the content after the iterator's
    /// current position.
    ///
    /// The resultant `UTF8Span` has the same lifetime constraints as `self`.
    public func suffix() -> UTF8Span
  }
}

```

### Character processing

We similarly propose a `UTF8Span.CharacterIterator` type that can do grapheme-breaking forwards and backwards.

The `CharacterIterator` assumes that the start and end of the `UTF8Span` is the start and end of content. 

Any scalar-aligned position is a valid place to start or reset the grapheme-breaking algorithm to, though you could get different `Character` output if resetting to a position that isn't `Character`-aligned relative to the start of the `UTF8Span` (e.g. in the middle of a series of regional indicators).

```swift

extension UTF8Span {
  /// Returns an iterator that will construct `Character`s from the underlying
  /// UTF-8 content.
  ///
  /// The resulting iterator has the same lifetime constraints as `self`.
  public func makeCharacterIterator() -> CharacterIterator

  /// Iterate the `Character` contents of a `UTF8Span`.
  public struct CharacterIterator: ~Escapable {
    public let codeUnits: UTF8Span

    /// The byte offset of the start of the next `Character`. This is always
    /// scalar-aligned. It is always `Character`-aligned relative to the last
    /// call to `reset` (or the start of the span if not called).
    public var currentCodeUnitOffset: Int { get private(set) }

    public init(_ span: UTF8Span)

    /// Return the `Character` starting at `currentCodeUnitOffset`. After the
    /// function returns, `currentCodeUnitOffset` holds the position at the
    /// end of the `Character`, which is also the start of the next
    /// `Character`. 
    ///
    /// Returns `nil` if at the end of the `UTF8Span`.
    public mutating func next() -> Character?

    /// Return the `Character` ending at `currentCodeUnitOffset`. After the
    /// function returns, `currentCodeUnitOffset` holds the position at the
    /// start of the returned `Character`, which is also the end of the
    /// previous `Character`. 
    ///
    /// Returns `nil` if at the start of the `UTF8Span`.
    public mutating func previous() -> Character?

    /// Advance `codeUnitOffset` to the end of the current `Character`,
    /// without constructing it.
    ///
    /// Returns the number of `Character`s skipped over, which can be 0
    /// if at the end of the UTF8Span.
    public mutating func skipForward() -> Int

    /// Advance `codeUnitOffset` to the end of `n` `Characters`, without
    /// constructing them.
    ///
    /// Returns the number of `Character`s skipped over, which can be
    /// fewer than `n` if at the end of the UTF8Span.
    public mutating func skipForward(by n: Int) -> Int

    /// Move `codeUnitOffset` to the start of the previous `Character`,
    /// without constructing it.
    ///
    /// Returns the number of `Character`s skipped over, which can be 0
    /// if at the start of the UTF8Span.
    public mutating func skipBack() -> Int

    /// Move `codeUnitOffset` to the start of the previous `n` `Character`s,
    /// without constructing them.
    ///
    /// Returns the number of `Character`s skipped over, which can be
    /// fewer than `n` if at the start of the UTF8Span.
    public mutating func skipBack(by n: Int) -> Int

    /// Reset to the nearest character-aligned position `<= i`.
    public mutating func reset(roundingBackwardsFrom i: Int)

    /// Reset to the nearest character-aligned position `>= i`.
    public mutating func reset(roundingForwardsFrom i: Int)

    /// Reset this iterator to code unit offset `i`, skipping _all_ safety
    /// checks (including bounds checks).
    ///
    /// Note: This is only for very specific, low-level use cases. If
    /// `codeUnitOffset` is not properly scalar-aligned, this function can
    /// result in undefined behavior when, e.g., `next()` is called. 
    ///
    /// If `i` is scalar-aligned, but not `Character`-aligned, you may get
    /// different results from running `Character` iteration.
    ///
    /// For example, this could be used by a regex engine to backtrack to a
    /// known-valid previous position.
    ///
    public mutating func reset(uncheckedAssumingAlignedTo i: Int)

    /// Returns the UTF8Span containing all the content up to the iterator's
    /// current position.
    ///
    /// The resultant `UTF8Span` has the same lifetime constraints as `self`.
    public func prefix() -> UTF8Span

    /// Returns the UTF8Span containing all the content after the iterator's
    /// current position.
    ///
    /// The resultant `UTF8Span` has the same lifetime constraints as `self`.
    public func suffix() -> UTF8Span
  }
}
```

### Comparisons

The content of a `UTF8Span` can be compared in a number of ways, including literally (byte semantics) and Unicode canonical equivalence.

```swift
extension UTF8Span {
  /// Whether this span has the same bytes as `other`.
  public func bytesEqual(to other: UTF8Span) -> Bool

  /// Whether this span has the same bytes as `other`.
  public func bytesEqual(to other: some Sequence<UInt8>) -> Bool

  /// Whether this span has the same `Unicode.Scalar`s as `other`.
  public func scalarsEqual(
    to other: some Sequence<Unicode.Scalar>
  ) -> Bool

  /// Whether this span has the same `Character`s as `other`, using
  /// `Character.==` (i.e. Unicode canonical equivalence).
  public func charactersEqual(
    to other: some Sequence<Character>
  ) -> Bool
}
```

We also support literal (i.e. non-canonical) pattern matching against `StaticString`.

```swift
extension UTF8Span {
  static func ~=(_ lhs: UTF8Span, _ rhs: StaticString) -> Bool
}
```

#### Canonical equivalence and ordering

`UTF8Span` can perform Unicode canonical equivalence checks (i.e. the semantics of `String.==` and `Character.==`).

```swift
extension UTF8Span {
  /// Whether `self` is equivalent to `other` under Unicode Canonical
  /// Equivalence.
  public func isCanonicallyEquivalent(
    to other: UTF8Span
  ) -> Bool

  /// Whether `self` orders less than `other` under Unicode Canonical
  /// Equivalence using normalized code-unit order (in NFC).
  public func isCanonicallyLessThan(
    _ other: UTF8Span
  ) -> Bool
}
```

#### Extracting sub-spans

Slicing a `UTF8Span` is nuanced and depends on the caller's desired use. They can only be sliced at scalar-aligned code unit offsets or else it will break the valid-UTF8 invariant. Furthermore, if the caller desires consistent grapheme breaking behavior without externally managing grapheme breaking state, they must be sliced along `Character` boundaries. For this reason, we have exposed slicing as `prefix` and `suffix` operations on `UTF8Span`'s iterators instead of `Span`'s' `extracting` methods.

### Queries

`UTF8Span` checks at construction time and remembers whether its contents are all ASCII. Additional checks can be requested and remembered.

```swift
extension UTF8Span {
  /// Returns whether contents are known to be all-ASCII. A return value of 
  /// `true` means that all code units are ASCII. A return value of `false` 
  /// means there _may_ be non-ASCII content.
  ///
  /// ASCII-ness is checked and remembered during UTF-8 validation, so this
  /// is often equivalent to is-ASCII, but there are some situations where 
  /// we might return `false` even when the content happens to be all-ASCII.
  ///
  /// For example, a UTF-8 span generated from a `String` that at some point 
  /// contained non-ASCII content would report false for `isKnownASCII`, even 
  /// if that String had subsequent mutation operations that removed any 
  /// non-ASCII content.
  public var isKnownASCII: Bool { get }

  /// Do a scan checking for whether the contents are all-ASCII.
  ///
  /// Updates the `isKnownASCII` bit if contents are all-ASCII.
  public mutating func checkForASCII() -> Bool

  /// Returns whether the contents are known to be NFC. This is not
  /// always checked at initialization time and is set by `checkForNFC`.
  public var isKnownNFC: Bool { get }

  /// Do a scan checking for whether the contents are in Normal Form C.
  /// When the contents are in NFC, canonical equivalence checks are much
  /// faster.
  ///
  /// `quickCheck` will check for a subset of NFC contents using the
  /// NFCQuickCheck algorithm, which is faster than the full normalization
  /// algorithm. However, it cannot detect all NFC contents.
  ///
  /// Updates the `isKnownNFC` bit.
  public mutating func checkForNFC(
    quickCheck: Bool
  ) -> Bool
}
```

### `UTF8Span` from `String`

We propose adding `utf8Span` properties to `String` and `Substring`, in line with [SE-0456](0456-stdlib-span-properties.md):

```swift
extension String {
  public var utf8Span: UTF8Span { borrowing get }
}
extension Substring {
  public var utf8Span: UTF8Span { borrowing get }
}
```


### `Span`-like functionality

A `UTF8Span` is similar to a `Span<UInt8>`, but with the valid-UTF8 invariant and additional information such as `isASCII`. We propose a way to get a `Span<UInt8>` from a `UTF8Span` as well as some methods directly on `UTF8Span`:

```
extension UTF8Span {
  public var isEmpty: Bool { get }

  public var span: Span<UInt8> { get }
}
```

## Source compatibility

This proposal is additive and source-compatible with existing code.

## ABI compatibility

This proposal is additive and ABI-compatible with existing code.

## Implications on adoption

The additions described in this proposal require a new version of the standard library and runtime.

## Future directions

### Streaming grapheme breaking

Grapheme-breaking, which identifies where the boundaries between `Character`s are, is more complex than scalar decoding. Grapheme breaking can be ran from any scalar-aligned position, either with a given state from having processed previous scalars, or with a "fresh" state (as though that position were the start of new content).

While the code units in a `UTF8Span` are always scalar-aligned (in order to be validly encoded), whether a span is grapheme-cluster aligned depends on its intended use. For example, `AttributedString` stores its content using rope-like storage, in which the entire content is a sequence of spans were each individual span is scalar-aligned but not necessarily grapheme-cluster aligned.

A potential approach to exposing this functionality is to make the stdlib's `GraphemeBreakingState` public and define API for finding grapheme-breaks.

```swift
extension Unicode {
  public struct GraphemeBreakingState: Sendable, Equatable {
    public init()
  }
}
```

One approach is to add API to the grapheme breaking state so that the state can find the next break (while updating itself). Another is to pass grapheme breaking state to an iterator on UTF8Span, like below:

```swift
extension UTF8Span {
  public struct GraphemeBreakIterator: ~Escapable {
    public var codeUnits: UTF8Span
    public var currentCodeUnitOffset: Int
    public var state: Unicode.GraphemeBreakingState

    public init(_ span: UTF8Span)

    public init(_ span: UTF8Span, using state: Unicode.GraphemeBreakingState)

### More alignments and alignment queries

Future API could include word iterators (either [simple](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Simple_Word_Boundaries) or [default](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Default_Word_Boundaries)), line iterators, etc.

Similarly, we could add API directly to `UTF8Span` for testing whether a given code unit offset is suitably aligned (including scalar or grapheme-cluster alignment checks).

### Creating `String` copies

We could add an initializer to `String` that makes an owned copy of a `UTF8Span`'s contents. Such an initializer can skip UTF-8 validation. 

Alternatively, we could defer adding anything until more of the `Container` protocol story is clear.

### Normalization

Future API could include checks for whether the content is in a particular normal form (not just NFC).

### UnicodeScalarView and CharacterView

Like `Span`, we are deferring adding any collection-like types to non-escapable `UTF8Span`. Future work could include adding view types that conform to a new `Container`-like protocol. 

See "Alternatives Considered" below for more rationale on not adding `Collection`-like API in this proposal.

### More algorithms

We propose equality checks (e.g. `scalarsEqual`), as those are incredibly common and useful operations. We have (tentatively) deferred other algorithms until non-escapable collections are figured out.

However, we can add select high-value algorithms if motivated by the community.

### More validation API

Future API could include a way to find and classify UTF-8 encoding errors in arbitrary byte sequences, beyond just `Span<UInt8>`.

We could propose something like:

```swift
extension UTF8 {
  public static func findFirstError(
    _ s: some Sequence<UInt8>
  ) -> UTF8.EncodingError?

  public static func findAllErrors(
    _ s: some Sequence<UInt8>
  ) -> some Sequence<UTF8.EncodingError>?
```

We are leaving this as future work. It also might be better formulated in line with a segemented-storage `Container`-like protocol instead of `some Sequence<UInt8>`.

For now, developers can validate UTF-8 and diagnose the location and type of error using `UTF8Span`'s validating initializer, which takes a `Span<UInt8>`. This is similar to how developers do UTF-8 validation [in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/fn.from_utf8.html).

### Transcoded iterators, normalized iterators, case-folded iterators, etc

We could provide lazily transcoded, normalized, case-folded, etc., iterators. If we do any of these for `UTF8Span`, we should consider adding equivalents views on `String`, `Substring`, etc.

### Regex or regex-like support

Future API additions would be to support `Regex`es on `UTF8Span`. We'd expose grapheme-level semantics, scalar-level semantics, and introduce byte-level semantics.

Another future direction could be to add many routines corresponding to the underlying operations performed by the regex engine, which would be useful for parser-combinator libraries who wish to expose `String`'s model of Unicode by using the stdlib's accelerated implementation.

### Track other bits

Future work include tracking whether the contents are NULL-terminated (useful for C bridging), whether the contents contain any newlines or only a single newline at the end (useful for accelerating Regex `.`), etc.

### Putting more API on String

`String` would also benefit from the query API, such as `isKnownNFC` and corresponding scan methods. Because a string may be a lazily-bridged instance of `NSString`, we don't always have the bits available to query or set, but this may become viable pending future improvements in bridging.

### Generalize printing and logging facilities

Many printing and logging protocols and facilities operate in terms of `String`. They could be generalized to work in terms of UTF-8 bytes instead, which is important for embedded.

## Alternatives considered

### Invalid start / end of input UTF-8 encoding errors

Earlier prototypes had `.invalidStartOfInput` and `.invalidEndOfInput` UTF8 validation errors to communicate that the input was perhaps incomplete or not slices along scalar boundaries. In this scenario, `.invalidStartOfInput` is equivalent to `.unexpectedContinuation` with the range's lower bound equal to 0 and `.invalidEndOfInput` is equivalent to `.truncatedScalar` with the range's upper bound equal to `count`.

This was rejected so as to not have two ways to encode the same error. There is no loss of information and `.unexpectedContinuation`/`.truncatedScalar` with ranges are more semantically precise.

### An unsafe UTF8 Buffer Pointer type

An [earlier pitch](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-utf-8-processing-over-unsafe-contiguous-bytes/69715) proposed an unsafe version of `UTF8Span`. Now that we have `~Escapable`, a memory-safe `UTF8Span` is better.

### Alternatives to Iterators

#### Functions

A previous version of this pitch had code unit offset taking API directly on UTF8Span instead of using iterators as proposed. This lead to a large number of unweildy API. For example, instead of:

```swift
extension UTF8Span.UnicodeScalarIterator {
  public mutating func next() -> Unicode.Scalar? { }
}
```

we had:

```swift
extension UTF8Span {
/// Decode the `Unicode.Scalar` starting at `i`. Return it and the start of
  /// the next scalar.
  ///
  /// `i` must be scalar-aligned.
  public func decodeNextScalar(
    _ i: Int
  ) -> (Unicode.Scalar, nextScalarStart: Int)

  /// Decode the `Unicode.Scalar` starting at `i`. Return it and the start of
  /// the next scalar.
  ///
  /// `i` must be scalar-aligned.
  ///
  /// This function does not validate that `i` is within the span's bounds;
  /// this is an unsafe operation.
  public func decodeNextScalar(
    unchecked i: Int
  ) -> (Unicode.Scalar, nextScalarStart: Int)

  /// Decode the `Unicode.Scalar` starting at `i`. Return it and the start of
  /// the next scalar.
  ///
  /// `i` must be scalar-aligned.
  ///
  /// This function does not validate that `i` is within the span's bounds;
  /// this is an unsafe operation.
  ///
  ///
  /// This function does not validate that `i` is scalar-aligned; this is an
  /// unsafe operation if `i` isn't.
  public func decodeNextScalar(
    uncheckedAssumingAligned i: Int
  ) -> (Unicode.Scalar, nextScalarStart: Int)
}
```

Every operation had `unchecked:` and `uncheckedAssumingAligned:` variants, which were needed to implement higher-performance constructs such as iterators and string processing features (including the `Regex` engine).

This API made the caller manage the scalar-alignment invariant, while the iterator-style API proposed maintains this invariant internally, allowing it to use the most efficient implementation.

Scalar-alignment can still be checked and managed by the caller through the `reset` API, which safely round forwards or backwards as needed. And, for high performance use cases where the caller knows that a given position is appropriately aligned already (for example, revisiting a prior point in a string during `Regex` processing), there's the `reset(uncheckedAssumingAlignedTo:)` API available.

#### View Collections

Another forumulation of these operations could be to provide a collection-like API phrased in terms of indices. Because `Collection`s are `Escapable`, we cannot conform nested `View` types to `Collection` so these would not benefit from any `Collection`-generic code, algorithms, etc. 

A benefit of such `Collection`-like views is that it could help serve as adapter code for migration. Existing `Collection`-generic algorithms and methods could be converted to support `UTF8Span` via copy-paste-edit. That is, a developer could interact with `UTF8Span` ala:

```swift
// view: UTF8Span.UnicodeScalarView
var curIdx = view.startIndex
while curIdx < view.endIndex {
  let scalar = view[curIdx]
  foo(scalar)
  view.formIndex(after: &curIndex)
}
```

in addition to the iterator approach of:

```swift
// iter: UTF8Span.UnicodeScalarIterator (or UTF8Span.UnicodeScalarView.Iterator)
while let scalar = iter.next() {
  foo(scalar)
}
```

However, the iterator-based approach is the more efficient and direct way to work with a `UTF8Span`. Even if we had `Collection`-like API, we'd still implement a custom iterator type and advocate its use as the best way to interact with `UTF8Span`. The question is whether or not, for a given `FooIterator` we should additionally provide a `FooView`, `FooView.Index`, `FooView.SubSequence`, (possibly) `FooView.Slice`, etc.

Idiomatic `Collection`-style interfaces support index interchange, even if "support" means reliably crashing after a dynamic check. Any idiomatic index-based interface would need to dynamically check for correct alignment in case the received index was derived from a different span. (There is a whole design space around smart indices and their tradeoffs, discussed in a [lengthy appendix](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0447-span-access-shared-contiguous-storage.md#appendix-index-and-slicing-design-considerations) in the Span proposal).

This means that `UTF8Span.UnicodeScalarView.subscript` would have to check for scalar alignment of its given index, as it does not know whether it originally produced the passed index or not. Similarly, `index(after:)`, `index(before:)`, `index(_:offsetBy:)`, etc., would make these checks on every call.

If we want to give the developer access to efficient formulations of index-style interfaces, we'd additionally propose `uncheckedAssumingAligned:` variants of nearly every method: `subscript(uncheckedAssumingAligned i:)`, `index(uncheckedAssumingAlignedAfter:)`, `index(uncheckedAssumingAlignedBefore:)`, `index(uncheckedAssumingAligned:offsetBy:)`, etc.. This also undermines the value of having an adapter to existing code patterns.

If we do provide view adapter code, the API could look a little different in that `UnicodeScalarIterator` is called `UnicodeScalarView.Iterator`, `prefix/suffix` are slicing, and the `reset()` functionality is expressed by slicing the view before creating an iterator. However, this would also have the effect of scattering the efficient API use pattern across multiple types, intermingled with inefficient or ill-advised adaptor interfaces which have the more idiomatic names.

Finally, in the future there will likely be some kind of `Container` protocol for types that can vend segments of contiguous storage. In our case, the segment type is `UTF8Span`, while the element is decoded from the underlying UTF-8. It's likely easier and more straightforward to retrofit or deprecate a single `UnicodeScalarIterator` type than a collection of types interrelated to each other.
