## Introduction

This proposal generalizes the `conformance` macro role as an `extension` macro role that can add a member list to an extension in addition to a protocol and `where` clause.

## Motivation

[SE-0389: Attached Macros](0389-attached-macros.md) introduced conformance macros, which expand to a conformance with a `where` clause written in an extension on the type the macro is attached to:

```swift
@attached(conformance)
macro AddEquatable() = #externalMacro(...)

@AddEquatable
struct S {}

// expands to
extension S: Equatable {}
```

However, the `conformance` macro role is extremely limited on its own. A conformance macro _only_ has the ability to return a protocol name and the syntax for a `where` clause. If the protocol conformance requires members --- as most protocol conformances do --- those must be added through a separate `member` macro role.

More importantly, conformance macros are the only way for a macro to expand to an extension on the annotated type. The inability to add members in an extension of a type rather than the primary declaration is a serious limitation of the macro system, because extensions have several important semantic implications, including (but not limited to):

* Protocols can only provide default implementations of requirements in extensions
* Initializers added in an extension of a type do not suppress the compiler-synthesized initializers
* Computed properties and methods in protocol and class extensions do not participate in dynamic dispatch

Extensions also have stylistic benefits. Code inside an extension will share the generic requirements on the extension itself rather than repeating the generic requirement on every method, and implementing conformance requirements in an extension is a common practice in Swift.

## Proposed solution

This proposal removes the `conformance` macro role in favor of an `extension` macro role. An `extension` macro role can be used with the `@attached` macro attribute, and it can add a conformance, a `where` clause, and a member list in an extension on the type the macro is attached to:

```swift
protocol MyProtocol {
  func requirement
}

@attached(extension, conformances: MyProtocol, names: named(requirement))
macro MyProtocol = #externalMacro(...)

@MyProtocol
struct S<T> {}

// expands to

extension S: MyProtocol where T: MyProtocol {
  func requirement() { ... }
}
```

The generated extensions of the macro must only extend the type the macro is attached to. Any conformances or members must also be specified upfront by the `@attached(extension)` attribute.

## Detailed design

### Specifying macro-introduced protocol conformances and member names

SE-0389 states that whenever a macro produces declarations that are visible to other Swift code, it is required to declare the names in advance. This rule also applies to extension macros, which must specify:

* Declarations inside the extension, which can be specified using `named`, `prefixed`, `suffixed`, and `arbitrary`.
* The names of protocols that are listed in the extension's conformance clause. These protocols are specified in the `conformances:` list of the `@attached(conformances:)` attribute. Each name that appears in this list must be a conformance constraint, where a conformance constraint is one of:
  * A protocol name
  * A typealias whose underlying type is a conformance constraint
  * A protocol composition whose entries are each a conformance constraint

The following restrictions apply to generated conformances and names listed in `@attached(extension)`:

* An extension macro cannot add a conformance to a protocol that is not covered by the `conformances:` list in `@attached(extension, conformances:)`.
* An extension macro cannot add a member that is not covered by the `names:` list in `@attached(extension, names:)`.
* An extension macro cannot introduce an extension with an attached `peer` macro, because the peer-macro-generated names are not covered by the original `@attached(extension)` attribute.

### Extension macro application

Extension macros can only be attached to the primary declaration of a nominal type; they cannot be attached to typealias or extension declarations.


Swift only allows `extension` declarations at the top level in a file. Despite this, extension macros can be applied to a nested type:

```swift
@attached(extension, conformances: MyProtocol, names: named(requirement))
macro MyProtocol = #externalMacro(...)

struct Outer {
  @MyProtocol
  struct Inner {}
}
```

In this situation, the macro expansion containing the `extension` is inserted at the top level of the file, instead of immediately where the macro is invoked, where the `extension` would be invalid. The above code expands to:

```swift
struct Outer {
  struct Inner {}
}

extension Outer.Inner: MyProtocol {
  func requirement() { ... }
}
```

It is an error to apply an extension macro to a local type, because there is no way to write an extension on a local type in Swift:

```swift
func test() {
  @MyProtocol // error
  struct LocalType {}
}
```

### Implementing extension macros

Extension macro implementations should conform to the `ExtensionMacro` protocol:

```swift
/// Describes a macro that can add extensions of the declaration it's
/// attached to.
public protocol ExtensionMacro: AttachedMacro {
  /// Expand an attached extension macro to produce the contents that will 
  /// create a set of extensions.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - node: The custom attribute describing the attached macro.
  ///   - declaration: The declaration the macro attribute is attached to.
  ///   - type: The type to provide extensions of.
  ///   - protocols: The list of protocols to add conformances to. These will
  ///     always be protocols that `type` does not already state a conformance
  ///     to.
  ///   - context: The context in which to perform the macro expansion.
  ///
  /// - Returns: the set of extension declarations introduced by the macro,
  ///   which are always inserted at top-level scope. Each extension must extend
  ///   the `type` parameter.
  static func expansion(
    of node: AttributeSyntax,
    attachedTo declaration: some DeclGroupSyntax,
    providingExtensionsOf type: some TypeSyntaxProtocol,
    conformingTo protocols: [TypeSyntax],
    in context: some MacroExpansionContext
  ) throws -> [ExtensionDeclSyntax]
}
```

Each `ExtensionDeclSyntax` in the resulting array must use the `providingExtensionsOf` parameter as the extended type, which is a qualified type name. For example, for the following code:

```swift
struct Outer {
  @MyProtocol
  struct Inner {}
}
```

The type syntax passed to `ExtensionMacro.expansion` for `providingExtensionsOf` is `Outer.Inner`.

#### Suppressing redundant conformances

The `conformingTo:` parameter of `ExtensionMacro.expansion` allows extension macros to suppress generating conformances that are already stated in the original source code. The `conformingTo:` argument array will contain only the protocols from the `conformances:` list in `@attached(extension conformances:)` that the type does not already conform to in the original source code, including through implied conformances or class inheritance.

For example, consider the following code which contains an attached extension macro:

```swift
protocol Encodable {}
protocol Decodable {}

typealias Codable = Encodable & Decodable

@attached(extension, conformances: Codable)
macro MyMacro() = #externalMacro(...)

@MyMacro
struct S { ... }

extension S: Encodable { ... }
```

The extension macro can add conformances to `Codable`, aka `Encodable & Decodable`. Because the struct `S` already conforms to `Encodable` in the original source, the `ExtensionMacro.expansion` method will receive the argument `[TypeSyntax(Encodable)]` for the `conformingTo:` parameter. Using this information, the macro implementation can decide to only add an extension with a conformance to `Decodable`.

## Source compatibility

This proposal removes the `conformance` macro role from SE-0389, which is accepted and implemented in Swift 5.9. If this proposal is accepted after 5.9, the `conformance` macro role will remain in the language as sugar for an `extension` macro that adds only a conformance.

## ABI compatibility

Extensions macros are expanded to regular Swift code at compile-time and have no ABI impact.

## Implications on adoption

The adoption implications for using extensions macros are the same as writing the expanded code manually in the project.
