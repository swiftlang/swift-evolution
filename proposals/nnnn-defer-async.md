# Support `async` calls in `defer` bodies

* Proposal: [SE-NNNN](NNNN-filename.md)
* Authors: [Freddy Kellison-Linn](https://github.com/Jumhyn)
* Review Manager: TBD
* Status: **Awaiting implementation**
* Implementation: [swiftlang/swift#NNNNN](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/pull/NNNNN)
* Review: ([pitch](https://forums.swift.org/...))

## Introduction

This is a targeted proposal to introduce support for asynchronous calls within `defer` statements. Such calls must be marked with `await` as any other asynchronous call would be, and `defer` statements which do asynchronous work will be implicitly awaited at any relevant scope exit point.

## Motivation

The `defer` statement was introduced in Swift 2 (before Swift was even open source) as the method for performing scope-based cleanup in a reliable way. Whenever a lexical scope is exited, the bodies of prior `defer` statements within that scope are executed (in reverse order, in the case of multiple `defer` statements).

```swift
func sendLog(_ message: String) async throws {
  let localLog = FileHandle("log.txt")
  
  // Will be executed even if we throw
  defer { localLog.close() }
  
  localLog.appendLine(message)
  try await sendNetworkLog(message)
}
```

This lets cleanup operations be syntactically colocated with the corresponding setup while also preventing the need to manually insert the cleanup along every possible exit path.

While this provides a convenient and less-bug-prone way to perform important cleanup, the bodies of `defer` statements are not permitted to do any asynchronous work. If you attempt to `await` something in the body of a `defer` statement, you'll get an error even if the enclosing context is `async`:

```swift
func f() async {
  await setUp()
  // error: 'async' call cannot occur in a defer body
  defer { await performAsyncTeardown() }
  
  try doSomething()
}
```

If a particular operation *requires* asynchronous cleanup, then there aren't any great options today. An author can either resort to inserting the cleanup on each exit path manually (risking that they or a future editor will miss a path), or else spawn a new top-level `Task` to perform the cleanup:

```swift
defer {
  // We'll clean this up... eventually
  Task { await performAsyncTeardown() }
}
```

## Proposed solution

This proposal allows `await` statements to appear in `defer` bodies whenever the enclosing context is already `async`. Whenever a scope is exited, the bodies of all prior `defer` statements will be executed in reverse order of declaration, just as before. The bodies of any `defer` statements containing asynchronous work will be `await`ed, and run to completion before the function returns.

Thus, the example from **Motivation** above will become valid code:
```swift
func f() async {
  await setUp()
  defer { await performAsyncTeardown() } // OK
  
  try doSomething()
}
```

## Detailed design

When a `defer` statement contains asynchronous work, we will generate an implicit `await` when it is called on scope exit. See **Alternatives Considered** for further discussion.

We always require that the parent context of the `defer` be explicitly or implicitly `async` in order for `defer` to contain an `await`. That is, the following is not valid:

```swift
func f() {
  // error: 'async' call in a function that does not support concurrency
  defer { await g() }
}
```

In positions where `async` can be inferred, such as for the types of closures, an `await` within the body of a `defer` is sufficient to infer `async`:

```swift
// 'f' implicitly has type '() async -> ()'
let f = {
  defer { await g() }
}
```

The body of a `defer` statement will always inherit the isolation of its enclosing scope, so an asynchronous `defer` body will never introduce *additional* suspension points beyond whatever suspension points are introduced by the functions it calls.

## Source compatibility

This change is additive and opt-in. Since no `defer` bodies today can do any asynchronous work, the behavior of existing code will not change.

## Alternatives considered

### Require some statement-level marking such as `defer async`

We do not require any more source-level annotation besides the `await` that will appear on the actual line within the `defer` which invokes the asynchronous work. We could go further and require one to write something like:
```swift
defer async {
  await fd.close()
}
```

This proposal declines to introduce such requirement. Because `defer` bodies are typically small, targeted cleanup work, we do not believe that substantial clarity is gained by requiring another marker which would remain local *to the `defer`* statement itself. Moreover, the enclosing context of such `defer` statements will *already* be required to be `async`. In the case of `func` declarations, this will be explicit. In the case of closures, this may be inferred, but will be no less implicit than the inference that already happens from having an `await` in a closure body.

### Require some sort of explicit `await` marking on scope exit

The decision to implicltly await asyncrhonous `defer` bodies has the potential to introduce unexpected suspension points within function bodies. This proposal takes the position that the implicit suspension points introduced by asynchronous `defer` bodies is almost entirely analagous to the [analysis](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0317-async-let.md#requiring-an-awaiton-any-execution-path-that-waits-for-an-async-let) provided by the `async let` proposal. Both of these proposals would require marking every possible control flow edge which exits a scope.

If anything, the analysis here is even more favorable to `defer`. In the case of `async let` it is possible to have an implicit suspension point without `await` appearing anywhere in the sourceâ€”with `defer`, any suspension point within the body will be marked with `await`.
