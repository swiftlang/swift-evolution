## Introduction

I propose adding a `mutating func toggle` to `Bool`. It toggles the `Bool`.

- Swift-evolution thread: [Discussion thread topic for that proposal](https://forums.swift.org/t/adding-toggle-to-bool/7414)
- Swift forums thread: [pitch: adding toggle to Bool](https://forums.swift.org/t/pitch-adding-toggle-to-bool/7414)

## Motivation

For `Bool` variables, it is common to want to toggle the state of the variable. In larger (nested) structs, the duplication involved can become especially annoying:

```swift
myVar.prop1.prop2.enabled = !myVar.prop1.prop2.enabled
```

It's also easy to make a mistake in the code above if there are multiple `Bool` vars.

## Proposed solution

Add a method `toggle` on `Bool`:

```swift
extension Bool {
  /// Equivalent to `someBool = !someBool`
  ///
  /// Useful when operating on long chains:
  ///
  ///    myVar.prop1.prop2.enabled.toggle()
  mutating func toggle() {
    self = !self
  }
}
```

This allows us to write the example above without duplication:

```swift
myVar.prop1.prop2.enabled.toggle()
```

`!` and `toggle()` mirror the API design for `-` and `negate()`. (Thanks to Xiaodi Wu for pointing this out).

## Detailed design

## Source compatibility

This is strictly additive.

## Effect on ABI stability

## Effect on API resilience

## Alternatives considered

Other names could be:

- `invert`
- `negate`
- `flip`

From the brief discussion on SE, it seems like `toggle` is the clear winner.

Some people also suggested adding a non-mutating variant (in other words, a method with the same semantics as the prefix `!` operator), but that's out of scope for this proposal, and in line with commonly rejected proposals.
