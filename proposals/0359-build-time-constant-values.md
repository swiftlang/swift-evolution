## Introduction

A Swift language feature for requiring certain values to be knowable at compile-time. This is achieved through an attribute, `@const`, constraining properties and function parameters to have compile-time knowable values. Such information forms a foundation for richer compile-time features in the future, such as extraction and validation of values at compile time.

## Motivation

Compile-time constant values are values that can be known or computed during compilation and are guaranteed to not change after compilation. Use of such values can have many purposes, from enforcing desirable invariants and safety guarantees to enabling users to express arbitrarily-complex compile-time algorithms. 

The first step towards building out support for compile-time constructs in Swift is a basic primitives consisting of an attribute to declare function parameters and properties to require being known at *compile-time*. While this requirement explicitly calls out the compiler as having additional guaranteed information about such declarations, it can be naturally extended into a broader sense of *build-time* known values - with the compiler being able to inform other tools with type-contextual value information. For an example of the latter, see the ‚ÄúDeclarative Package Manifest‚Äù motivating use-case below.

## Proposed Solution

The Swift compiler will recognize declarations of properties, local variables, and function parameters declared with a `@const` attribute as having an additional requirement to be known at compile-time. If a `@const` property or variable is initialized with a runtime value, the compiler will emit an error. Similarly, if a runtime value is passed as an argument to a `@const` function parameter, the compiler will emit an error. Aside from participating in name mangling, the attribute has no runtime effect.

For example, a `@const` property can provide the compiler and relevant tooling build-time knowledge of a type-specific value:

```swift
struct DatabaseParams {
  @const let encoding: String = "utf-8"
  @const let capacity: Int = 256
}
```

A `@const` parameter provides a guarantee of a build-time-known argument being specified at all function call-sites, allowing future APIs to enforce invariants and provide build-time correctness guarantees:

```swift
func acceptingURLString(@const _ url: String)
```

And a `@const static let` protocol property requirement allows protocol authors to enforce get the benefits of build-time known properties for all conforming types:

```swift
protocol DatabaseSerializableWithKey {
    @const static let key: String
}
```

## Detailed Design

### Property `@const` attribute

A stored property on a `struct` or a `class` can be marked with a `@const` attribute to indicate that its value is known at compile-time.
```swift
struct Foo {
  @const let title: String = "foo"
}
```
The value of such a property must be default-initialized with a compile-time-known value, unlike a plain `let` property, which can also be assigned a value in the type's initializer. 

```swift
struct Foo {
  // üëç
  @const let superTitle: String = "Encyclopedia"
  // ‚ùå error: `title` must be initialized with a const value
  @const let title: String
  // ‚ùå error: `subTitle` must be initialized with a const value
  @const let subTitle: String = bar() 
}
```

Similarly to Implicitly-Unwrapped Optionals, the mental model for semantics of this attribute is that it is a flag on the declaration that  guarantees that the compiler is able to know its value as shared by all instance of the type. For now, `@const let` and `@const static let` are equivalent in what information the `@const` attribute conveys to the compiler. 

### Parameter `@const` attribute

A function parameter can be marked with a `@const`  keyword to indicate that values passed to this parameter at the call-site must be compile-time-known values.

```swift
func foo(@const input: Int) {...}
```

Passing in a runtime value as an argument to `foo` will result in a compilation error:
```swift
foo(11) // üëç

let x: Int = computeRuntimeCount()
foo(x) // ‚ùå error: 'greeting' must be initialized with a const value
```

### Protocol `@const` property requirement 

A protocol author may require conforming types to default initialize a given property with a compile-time-known value by specifying it as `@const static let` in the protocol definition. For example:

```swift
protocol NeedsConstGreeting {
    @const static let greeting: String
}
```
Unlike other property declarations on protocols that require the use of `var` and explicit specification of whether the property must provide a getter `{ get }` or also a setter `{ get set }`, using `var` for build-time-known properties whose values are known to be fixed at runtime is counter-intuitive. Moreover, `@const` implies the lack of a run-time setter and an implicit presence of the value getter.

If a conforming type initializes `greeting` with something other than a compile-time-known value, a compilation error is produced:

```swift
struct Foo: NeedsConstGreeting {
  // üëç
  static let greeting = "Hello, Foo"
}
struct Bar: NeedsConstGreeting {
  // error: ‚ùå 'greeting' must be initialized with a const value
  static let greeting = "\(Bool.random ? "Hello" : "Goodbye"), Bar"
}
```

### Supported Types

The requirement that values of `@const` properties and parameters be known at compile-time restricts the allowable types for such declarations. The current scope of the proposal includes:

* Enum cases with no associated values
* Certain standard library types that are expressible with literal values
* Integer and Floating-Point types (`(U)?Int(\d*)`, `Float`, `Double`, `Half`), `String` (excluding interpolated strings), `Bool`.
* `Array` and `Dictionary` literals consisting of literal values of above types.
* Tuple literals consisting of the above list items.

This list will expand in the future to include more literal-value kinds or potential new compile-time valued constructs.

## Motivating Example Use-Cases

### Enforcement of Compile-Time Attribute Parameters

Attribute definitions can benefit from additional guarantees of compile-time constant values.
For example, a `@const` version of the [@Clamping](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0258-property-wrappers.md#clamping-a-value-within-bounds) property wrapper that requires that lower and upper bounds be compile-time-known values can ensure that the clamp values are fixed and cannot change for different instantiations of wrapped properties which may occur if runtime values are used to specify the bounds:

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct Clamping<V: Comparable> {
  var value: V
  let min: V
  let max: V

  init(wrappedValue: V, @const min: V, @const max: V) {
    value = wrappedValue
    self.min = min
    self.max = max
    assert(value >= min && value <= max)
  }
  ...
```
It could also allow the compiler to generate more-efficient comparison and clamping code, in the future.

Or imagine a property wrapper that declares a property is to be serialized and that it must be stored/retrieved using a specific string key. `Codable` requires users to provide a `CodingKeys` `enum` boilerplate, relying on the `enum`‚Äôs `String` raw values. Alternatively, such key can be specified on the property wrapper itself:

```swift
struct Foo {
  @SpecialSerializationSauce(key: "title") 
  var someSpecialTitleProperty: String
}

@propertyWrapper
struct SpecialSerializationSauce {
  init(@const key: String) {...}
}
```

Having the compiler enforce the compile-time constant property of the `key` parameter eliminates the possibility of an error where a run-time value is specified which can cause serialized data to not be able to be deserialized, for example. 

Enforcing compile-time constant nature of the parameters is also the first step to allowing attribute/library authors to be able to check uses by performing compile-time sanity checking and having the capability to emit custom build-time error messages.

### Enforcement of Non-Failable Initializers

Ergonomics of the recently-pitched [Foundation.URL](https://forums.swift.org/t/foundation-url-improvements/54057) would benefit greatly from the ability to require the string argument to be compile-time constant. With evolving compile-time evaluation facilities, Swift may even gain an ability to perform compile-time validation of such URLs  even though the user may never be able to express a fully compile-time constant `Foundation.URL` type because this type is a part of an ABI-stable SDK. While a type like `StaticString` may be used to require that the argument string must be static, which string is chosen can still be determined at runtime, e.g.:

```swift
URL(Bool.random() ? "https://valid.url.com" : "invalid url . com")
```

### Facilitate Compile-time Extraction of Values

The [Result Builder-based SwiftPM Manifest](https://forums.swift.org/t/pre-pitch-swiftpm-manifest-based-on-result-builders/53457) pre-pitch outlines a proposal for a manifest format that encodes package model/structure using Swift‚Äôs type system via Result Builders. Extending the idea to use the builder pattern throughout can result in a declarative specification that exposes the entire package structure to build-time tools, for example:

```swift
let package = Package {
  Modules {
    Executable("MyExecutable", public: true, include: {
        Internal("MyDataModel")
      })
    Library("MyLibrary", public: true, include: {
        Internal("MyDataModel", public: true)
      })
    Library("MyDataModel")
    Library("MyTestUtilities")
    Test("MyExecutableTests", for: "MyExecutable", include: {
        Internal("MyTestUtilities")
        External("SomeModule", from: "some-package") 
      })
    Test("MyLibraryTests", for: "MyLibrary")
  }
  Dependencies {
    SourceControl(at: "https://git-service.com/foo/some-package", upToNextMajor: "1.0.0")
  } 
}
```

A key property of this specification is that all the information required to know how to build this package is encoded using compile-time-known concepts: types and literal (and therefore compile-time-known) values. This means that for a category of simple packages where such expression of the package‚Äôs model is possible, the manifest does not need to be executed in a sandbox by the Package Manager - the required information can be extracted at manifest *build* time.

To *ensure* build-time extractability of the relevant manifest structure, a form of the above API can be provided that guarantees the compile-time known properties. For example, the following snippet can guarantee the ability to extract complete required knowledge at build time:

```swift
Test("MyExecutableTests", for: "MyExecutable", include: {
        Internal("MyTestUtilities")
        External("SomeModule", from: "some-package") 
      })
```
By providing a specialized version of the relevant types (`Test`, `Internal`, `External`) that rely on parameters relevant to extracting the package structure being `const`:

```swift
struct Test {
  init(@const _ title: String, @const for: String, @DependencyBuilder include: ...) {...} 
}
struct Internal {
  init(@const _ title: String)
}
struct External {
  init(@const _ title: String, @const from: String)
}
```
This could, in theory, allow SwiftPM to build such packages without executing their manifest. Some packages, of course, could still require run-time (execution at package build-time) Swift constructs. More-generally, providing the possibility of declarative APIs that can express build-time-knowable abstractions can both eliminate (in some cases) the need for code execution - reducing the security surface area - and allow for further novel use-cases of Swift‚Äôs DSL capabilities (e.g. build-time extractable database schema, etc.). 

### Guaranteed Optimization Hints

Similarly, ergonomics of numeric intrinsics can benefit from allowing only certain function parameters to be required to be compile-time known. For example, requiring a given numeric operation to specify a `@const` parameter for the rounding mode of an operation as an enum case, while allowing the operands of the operation be runtime values, allowing the compiler to generate more-efficient code. 

## Source compatibility

This is a purely additive change and has no source compatibility impacts.

## Effect on ABI stability and API resilience

The new function parameter attribute is a part of name mangling. The *value* of `public @const` properties is a part of a module's ABI. See discussion on [*Memory placement*](#memory-placement-and-runtime-initialization) for details.

## Effect on SwiftPM packages

There is no impact on SwiftPM packages.

## Alternatives Considered

### Using a keyword or an introducer instead of an attribute
`@const` being an attribute, as opposed to a keyword or a new introducer (such as `const` instead of `let`), is an approach that is more amenable to applying to a greater variety of constructs in the futures, in addition to property and parameter declarations, such as `@const func`. In addition, as described in comparison to Implicitly-Unwrapped Optionals above, this attribute does not fundamentally change the behavior of the declaration, rather it restricts its handling by the compiler, similar to `@objc`.

### Difference to `StaticString`-like types
As described in the **Enforcement of Non-Failable Initializers**, the key difference to types like `StaticString` that require a literal value is the `@const` attribute's requirement that the exact value be known at compile-time. `StaticString` allows for a runtime selection of multiple compile-time known values.

### Placing `@const` on the declaration type
One alternative to declaring compile-time known values as proposed here with the declaration attribute:

```swift
@const let x = 11
```
Is to instead shift the annotation to declared property's type:

```swift
let x: @const Int = 11
```
This shifts the information conveyed to the compiler about this declaration to be carried by the declaration's type. Semantically, this departs from, and widely broadens the scope from what we intend to capture: the knowability of the declared *value*. Encoding the compile-time property into the type system would force us to reckon with a great deal of complexity and unintended consequences. Consider the following example:

```swift
typealias CI = @const Int
let x: CI?
```
What is the type of `x`? It appears to be Optional<@const Int>, which is not a meaningful or useful type, and the programmer most likely intended to have a @const Optional<Int>. And although today Implicitly-Unwrapped optional syntax conveys an additional bit of information about the declared value using a syntactic indicator on the declared type, without affecting the declaration's type, the [historical context](https://www.swift.org/blog/iuo/) of that feature makes it a poor example to justify requiring consistency with it.

### Alternative attribute names
More-explicit spellings of the attribute's intent were proposed in the form of `@buildTime`/`@compileTime`/`@comptime`, and the use of `const` was also examined as a holdover from its use in C++.

While build-time knowability of values this attribute covers is one of the intended semantic takeaways, the potential use of this attribute for various optimization purposes also lends itself to indicate the additional immutability guarantees on top of a plain `let` (which can be initialized with a dynamic value), as well as capturing the build-time evaluation/knowledge signal. For example, in the case of global variables, thread-safe lazy initialization of `@const` variables may no longer be necessary, in which case the meaning of the term `const` becomes even more explicit.

Similarly with the comparison to C++, where the language uses the term `const` to describe a runtime behaviour concept, rather than convey information about the actual value. The use of the term `const` is more in line with the mathematical meaning of having the value be a **defined** constant. 

## Forward-Looking Design Aspects and Future Directions

### Future Inference/Propagation Rules
Though this proposal does **not** itself introduce rules of `@const` inference, their future existence is worth discussing in this design. Consider the example:

```swift
@const let i = 1
let j = i
```
While not valid under this proposal, our intent is to allow the use of `i` where `@const` values are expected in the future, for example `@const let k = i` or `f(i)` where `f` is `func f(@const _: Int)`. It is therefore important to consider whether `@const` is propagated to values like `j` in the above example, which determines whether or not statements like `f(j)` and `@const let k = j` are valid code. While it is desirable to allow such uses of the value within the same compilation unit, if `j` is `public`, automatically inferring it to be `@const` is problematic at the module boundary: it creates a contract with the module's clients that the programmer may not have intended. Therefore, `public` properties must explicitly be marked `@const` in order to be accessible as such outside the defining module. This is similar in nature to `Sendable` inference - `internal` or `private` entities can automatically be inferred by the compiler as `Sendable`, while `public` types must explicitly opt-in.

### Memory placement and runtime initialization
Effect on runtime placement of `@const` values is an implementation detail that this proposal does not cover beyond indicating that today this attribute has no effect on memory layout of such values at runtime. It is however a highly desirable future direction for the implementation of this feature to allow the use of read-only memory for `@const` values. With this in mind, it is important to allow semantics of this attribute to allow such implementation in the future. For example, a global `@const let`, by being placed into read-only memory removes the need for synchronization on access to such data. Moreover, using read-only memory reduces memory pressure that comes from having to maintain all mutable state in-memory at a given program point - read-only data can be evicted on-demand to be read back later. These are desirable traits for optimization of existing programs which become increasingly important for enabling of low-level system programs to be written in Swift.

In order to allow such implementation in the future, this proposal makes the *value* of `public` `@const` values/properties a part of a module's ABI. That is, a resilient library that vends `@const let x = 11` changing the value of `x` is considered an ABI break. This treatment allows `public` `@const` data to exist in a single read-only location shared by all library clients, without each client having to copy the value or being concerned with possible inconsistency in behavior across library versions.

## Future Directions

### Constant-propagation
Allow default-initialization of `@const` properties using other `@const` values and allow passing `@const` values to `@const` parameters. The [Future Inference/Propagation Rules](#future-inferencepropagation-rules) section discusses a direction for enabling inference of the attribute on values. This is a necessary next building-block to generalizing the use of compile-time values.

```swift
func foo(@const i: Int) {
     @const let j = i
}
```

### Toolchain support for extracting compile-time values at build time.
The current proposal covers an attribute that allows clients to build an API surface that is capable of carrying semantic build-time information that may be very useful to build-time tooling, such as [SwiftPM plugins](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0303-swiftpm-extensible-build-tools.md). The next step towards this goal would include toolchain support for tooling that extracts such information in a client-agnostic fashion so that it can be adopted equally by use-cases like the manifest example in [Facilitate Compile-time Extraction of Values](#facilitate-compile-time-extraction-of-values) and others.

### Compile-time expressions and functions
Building on propagation and inference of `@const`, some of the most interesting use-cases for compile-time-known values emerge with the ability to perform operations on them that result in other compile-time-known values. For example, the [Compiler Diagnostic Directives](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0196-diagnostic-directives.md) could be expanded to trigger conditionally based on a value of a compile-time-known input expression:

```swift
func foo(@const input: Int) {
   #const_assert(input <= 0, "'foo()' expects a positive input")
}
```
Which would require that it is possible to evaluate the `input <= 0` expression at compile-time, which would also require that certain functions can be evaluated at compile-time if their arguments are known at compile-time. For example:


```swift
func <=(@const lhs: Int, @const rhs: Int) -> Bool
```
Inference on which functions can or cannot be evaluated at compile time will be defined in a future proposal and can follow similar ideas to those described in [Future Inference/Propagation Rules](#future-inferencepropagation-rules) section.

### Compile-time types
Finally, the flexibility of build-time values and code that operates on them can be greatly expanded by allowing entire user-defined types to form compile-time-known values via either custom literal syntax or having a `@const` initializer.
