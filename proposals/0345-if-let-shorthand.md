## Introduction

Optional binding using `if let foo = foo { ... }`, to create an unwrapped variable that shadows an existing optional variable, is an extremely common pattern. This pattern requires the author to repeat the referenced identifier twice, which can cause these optional binding conditions to be verbose, especially when using lengthy variable names. We should introduce a shorthand syntax for optional binding when shadowing an existing variable:

```swift
let foo: Foo? = ...

if let foo {
    // `foo` is of type `Foo`
}
```

Swift-evolution thread: [`if let` shorthand](https://forums.swift.org/t/if-let-shorthand/54230)

## Motivation

Reducing duplication, especially of lengthy variable names, makes code both easier to write _and_ easier to read.

For example, this statement that unwraps `someLengthyVariableName` and `anotherImportantVariable` is rather arduous to read (and was without a doubt arduous to write):

```swift
let someLengthyVariableName: Foo? = ...
let anotherImportantVariable: Bar? = ...

if let someLengthyVariableName = someLengthyVariableName, let anotherImportantVariable = anotherImportantVariable {
    ...
}
```

One approach for dealing with this is to use shorter, less descriptive, names for the unwrapped variables:

```swift
if let a = someLengthyVariableName, let b = anotherImportantVariable {
    ...
}
```

This approach, however, reduces clarity at the point of use for the unwrapped variables. Instead of encouraging short variable names, we should allow for the ergonomic use of descriptive variable names.

## Proposed solution

If we instead omit the right-hand expression, and allow the compiler to automatically shadow the existing variable with that name, these optional bindings are much less verbose, and noticeably easier to read / write:

```swift
let someLengthyVariableName: Foo? = ...
let anotherImportantVariable: Bar? = ...

if let someLengthyVariableName, let anotherImportantVariable {
    ...
}
```

This is a fairly natural extension to the existing syntax for optional binding conditions.

## Detailed design

Specifically, this proposal extends the Swift grammar for [`optional-binding-condition`](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Statements.html#grammar_optional-binding-condition)s. 

This is currently defined as:

> optional-binding-condition â†’ **let** [pattern](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Patterns.html#grammar_pattern) [initializer](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Declarations.html#grammar_initializer) | **var** [pattern](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Patterns.html#grammar_pattern) [initializer](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Declarations.html#grammar_initializer)

and would be updated to:

> optional-binding-condition â†’ **let** [pattern](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Patterns.html#grammar_pattern) [initializer](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Declarations.html#grammar_initializer)<sub>opt</sub> | **var** [pattern](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Patterns.html#grammar_pattern) [initializer](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Declarations.html#grammar_initializer)<sub>opt</sub>

This would apply to all conditional control flow statements:

```swift
if let foo { ... }
if var foo { ... }

else if let foo { ... }
else if var foo { ... }

guard let foo else { ... }
guard var foo else { ... }

while let foo { ... }
while var foo { ... }
```

The compiler would synthesize an initializer expression that references the variable being shadowed. 

For example:

```swift
if let foo { ... }
```

is transformed into:

```swift
if let foo = foo { ... }
```

Explicit type annotations are permitted, like with standard optional binding conditions.

For example:

```swift
if let foo: Foo { ... }
```

is transformed into:

```swift
if let foo: Foo = foo { ... }
```

The pattern following the introducer serves as both an evaluated expression _and_ an identifier for the newly-defined non-optional variable. Existing precedent for this type of syntax includes closure capture lists, which work the same way:

```swift
let foo: Foo
let closure = { [foo] in // `foo` is both an expression and the identifier 
    ...                  // for a new variable defined within the closure
}
```

Because of this, only valid identifiers would be permitted with this syntax. For example, this example would not be valid:

```swift
if let foo.bar { ... } // ðŸ›‘ unwrap condition requires a valid identifier
       ^               // fix-it: insert `<#identifier#> = `
```

### Interaction with implicit self

Like with existing optional bindings, this new syntax would support implifict self references to unwrap optional members of `self`. For example, the usage in this example would be permitted:

```swift
struct UserView: View {
  let name: String
  let emailAddress: String?

  var body: some View {
    VStack {
      Text(user.name)

      // Equivalent to `if let emailAddress = emailAddress { ... }`,
      // unwraps `self.emailAddress`.
      if let emailAddress {
        Text(emailAddress)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Source compatibility

This change is purely additive and does not break source compatibility of any valid existing Swift code.

## Effect on ABI stability

This change is purely additive, and is a syntactic transformation to existing valid code, so has no effect on ABI stability.

## Effect on API resilience

This change is purely additive, and is a syntactic transformation to existing valid code, so has no effect on ABI stability.

## Future directions

### Optional casting

A natural extension of this new syntax could be to support shorthand for optional casting. For example:

`if let foo as? Bar { ... }`

could be equivalent to:

`if let foo = foo as? Bar { ... }`

This is not included in this proposal, but is a reasonable feature that could be added in the future.

### Interaction with future borrow introducers

["A roadmap for improving Swift performance predictability"](https://forums.swift.org/t/a-roadmap-for-improving-swift-performance-predictability-arc-improvements-and-ownership-control/54206#borrow-variables-7) discusses potential new `ref` and `inout` introducers for creating variables that "borrow" existing variables without making a copy (by enforcing exclusive access). For consistency with `let` / `var`, it will likely make sense to support optional binding conditions for these new introducers:

```swift
if ref foo = foo {
  // if `foo` is not nil, it is borrowed and made available as a non-optional, immutable variable
}

if inout foo = &foo {
  // if `foo` is not nil, it is borrowed and made available as a non-optional, mutable variable
}
```

The shorthand syntax for `let` / `var` optional bindings would extend fairly naturally to these new introducers:

```swift
if ref foo {
  // if `foo` is not nil, it is borrowed and made available as a non-optional, immutable variable
}

if inout &foo {
  // if `foo` is not nil, it is borrowed and made available as a non-optional, mutable variable
}
```

### Unwrapping nested members of objects

This proposal doesn't permit shorthand unwrapping for members nested in other objects. For example:

`if let foo.bar { ... } // ðŸ›‘`

There are a few different options that could allow us to support this type of syntax in the future.

One approach could be to automatically synthesize the identifier name for the unwrapped variable in the inner scope. For example. `if let foo.bar` could introduce a new non-optional variable named `bar` or `fooBar`. 

Another approach could be to permit this for potential future borrow introducers `ref` and `inout` (from ["A roadmap for improving Swift performance predictability"](https://forums.swift.org/t/a-roadmap-for-improving-swift-performance-predictability-arc-improvements-and-ownership-control/54206#borrow-variables-7)). These borrows would have compiler-enforced exclusive access to the underlying storage, so they technically do not require a unique identifier name for the inner scope. This could allow us to unwrap members of objects without any new variables or copies. For example:

```swift
// `mother.father.sister` is optional

if ref mother.father.sister {
  // `mother.father.sister` is non-optional and immutable
}

if inout &mother.father.sister {
  // `mother.father.sister` is non-optional and mutable
}
```

## Alternatives considered

There have been many other proposed spellings for this feature:

### `if foo`

The briefest possible spelling for this feature would just be a bare `if foo` condition. This spelling, however, would create ambiguity between optional unwrapping conditions and boolean conditions, and could lead to confusing / conter-intuitive situations:

```swift
let foo: Bool = true
let bar: Bool? = false

if foo, bar {
  // would succeed
}

if foo == true, bar == true {
  // would fail
}
```

To avoid this ambiguity, we need some sort of distinct syntax for optional bindings.

### `if unwrap foo`

Another option is to introduce a new keyword or sigil for this purpose, like `if unwrap foo`, `if foo?` or `if have foo`.

A key benefit of introducing a completely new syntax like `if unwrap foo` is that it gives us the opportunity to also revisit the _semantics_ of how optional binding conditions actually work. Today, optional binding conditions always make a copy of the value. From a performance perspective, it would be more efficient to perform a _borrow_ instead of a copy. 

["A roadmap for improving Swift performance predictability"](https://forums.swift.org/t/a-roadmap-for-improving-swift-performance-predictability-arc-improvements-and-ownership-control/54206#borrow-variables-7) discusses potential future introducers `ref` (to perform an immutable borrow) and `inout` (to perform a mutable borrow). For consistency with `let` / `var`, it will likely make sense to support optional binding conditions for these new introducers:

```swift
if ref foo = foo {
  // if `foo` is not nil, it is borrowed and made available as a non-optional, immutable variable
}

if inout foo = &foo {
  // if `foo` is not nil, it is borrowed and made available as a non-optional, mutable variable
}
```

Instead of being shorthand for `if let`, this new shorthand syntax could instead be shorthand for `if ref`. This would improve performance in general, and could nudge users towards using borrows instead of copies (since only the borrow form would receive shorthand sugar).

A key downside of borrows, however, is that they require exclusive access to the borrowed variable. Memory exclusivity violations will result in compiler errors in some cases, but can also manifest as runtime errors in more complex cases. For example:

```swift
var x: Int? = 1

func increment(by number: Int) {
    x? += number
}

if ref x = x {
    increment(by: x)
}
```

This would trap at runtime, because `increment(by:)` would attempt to modify the value of `x` while it is already being borrowed by the `if ref x = x` optional binding condition. 

Once borrow introducers are added to the language, seeing `ref x` or `inout x` anywhere in Swift will serve as an important visual marker about the exclusivity requirements of the code. On the other hand, a new syntax like `if unwrap x` doesn't explicitly indicate that the variable is being borrowed. This could lead to users being surprised by unexpected exclusivity violations, which could cause confusing compile-time errors or runtime crashes.

Borrow introducers will be very useful, but adopting them is a tradeoff between performance and conceptual overhead. Borrows are cheap but come with high conceptual overhead. Copies can be expensive but always work as expected without much extra thought. Given this tradeoff, it likely makes sense for this shorthand syntax to provide a way for users to choose between performing a copy or performing a borrow, rather than limiting users to one or the other.

Additionally, for consistency with existing optional binding conditions, this new shorthand should support the distinction between immutable and mutable variables. Combined with the distinction between copies and borrows, that would give us the same set of options as normal variables:

```swift
// Included in this proposal:
if let foo { /* foo is an immutable copy */ }
if var foo { /* foo is a mutable copy */ }

// Potentially added in the future:
if ref foo { /* foo is an immutable borrow */ }
if inout &foo { /* foo is a mutable borrow */ }
```

Since we already have syntax for these concepts, we should reuse that syntax in this shorthand rather than create a new syntax that is less expressive (e.g. only supports a subset of the available options) and less explicit (e.g. that users would have to memorize whether this new shorthand performs a copy or a borrow).

### `if let foo?`

Another option is to include a `?` to explicitly indicate that this is unwrapping an optional, using `if let foo?`. This is indicative of the existing `case let foo?` pattern matching syntax.

`if let foo = foo` (the most common existing syntax for this) unwraps optionals without an explicit `?`. This implies that a conditional optional binding is sufficiently clear without a `?` to indicate the presence of an optional. If this is the case, then an additional `?` is likely not strictly necessary in the shorthand `if let foo` case.

While the symmetry of `if let foo?` with `case let foo?` is nice, consistency with `if let foo = foo` is even more important condiering they will more frequently appear within the same statement:

```swift
// Consistent
if let user, let defaultAddress = user.shippingAddresses.first { ... }

// Inconsistent
if let user?, let defaultAddress = user.shippingAddresses.first { ... }
```

Additionally, the `?` symbol makes it trickier to support explicit type annotations like in `if let foo: Foo = foo`. `if let foo: Foo` is a natural consequence of the existing grammar. It's less clear how this would work with an additional `?`. `if let foo?: Foo` likely makes the most sense, but doesn't match any existing language constructs.

### `if foo != nil`

One somewhat common proposal is to permit `nil`-checks (like `if foo != nil`) to unwrap the variable in the inner scope. Kotlin supports this type of syntax:

```kt
var foo: String? = "foo"
print(foo?.length) // "3"

if (foo != null) {
    // `foo` is non-optional
    print(foo.length) // "3"
}
```

This pattern in Kotlin _does not_ define a new variable -- it merely changes the type of the existing variable within the inner scope. So mutations that affect the inner scope also affect the outer scope:

```kt
var foo: String? = "foo"

if (foo != null) {
    print(foo) // "foo"
    foo = "bar"
    print(foo) // "bar"
}

print(foo) // "bar"
```

This is different from Swift's optional binding conditions (`if let foo = foo`), which define a new, _separate_ variable in the inner scope. This is a defining characteristic of optional binding conditions in Swift, so any shorthand syntax must make it abundantly clear that a new variable is being declared.

### Don't permit `if var foo`

Since `if var foo = foo` is significantly less common than `if let foo = foo`, we could potentially choose to _not_ support `var` in this shorthand syntax. 

`var` shadowing has the potential to be more confusing than `let` shadowing -- `var` introduces a new _mutable_ variable, and any mutations to the new variable are not shared with the original optional variable. On the other hand, `if var foo = foo` already exists, and it seems unlikely that `if var foo` would be more confusing / less clear than the existing syntax.

Since `let` and `var` are interchangeable elsewhere in the language, that should also be the case here -- disallowing `if var foo` would be inconsistent with existing optional binding condition syntax. If we were using an alternative spelling that _did not_ use `let`, it may be reasonable to exclude `var` -- but since we are using `let` here, `var` should also be allowed.
