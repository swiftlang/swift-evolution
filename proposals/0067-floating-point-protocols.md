# Enhanced Floating Point Protocols

* Proposal: [SE-0067](0067-floating-point-protocols.md)
* Author: [Stephen Canon](https://github.com/stephentyrone)
* Review Manager: [Chris Lattner](https://github.com/lattner)
* Status: **Implemented (Swift 3.0)**
* Decision Notes: [Rationale](https://forums.swift.org/t/accepted-se-0067-enhanced-floating-point-protocols/2420)
* Implementation: [apple/swift#2453](https://github.com/apple/swift/pull/2453)
* Previous Revision: [1](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/fb1368a6a5474f57aa8f1846b5355d18753098f3/proposals/0067-floating-point-protocols.md)

## Introduction

The current FloatingPoint protocol is quite limited, and provides only a small
subset of the features expected of an IEEE 754 conforming type.  This proposal
expands the protocol to cover most of the expected basic operations, and adds
a second protocol, BinaryFloatingPoint, that provides a number of useful tools
for generic programming with the most commonly used types.

Revision 2 reintroduces some of the details of the `Arithmetic` protocol from
earlier drafts of this proposal, but as methods in the `FloatingPoint` API,
with the goal of reducing the number of overloads for basic operations.  This
change was requested by some members of the core language team.

Revision 2 also incorporates a number of suggestions from the review list and
corrects some typos; thanks especially to Xiaodi Wu for thoughtful feedback.
Consult the changelog at the end of this document for full details.

## Motivation

Beside the high-level motivation provided by the introduction, the proposed
prototypes address a number of pain points that we've heard about from
developers:

- FloatingPoint should conform to Equatable, and Comparable
- FloatingPoint should conform to FloatLiteralConvertible
- Deprecate the `%` operator for floating-point types
- Provide basic constants (analogues of C's DBL_MAX, etc.)
- Make Float80 conform to FloatingPoint

## Detailed design

The `FloatingPoint` protocol is split into two parts; `FloatingPoint` and
`BinaryFloatingPoint`, which conforms to `FloatingPoint`.  If decimal
types were added at some future point, they would conform to
`DecimalFloatingPoint`.

`FloatingPoint` is expanded to contain most of the IEEE 754 basic
operations, as well as conformance to `Comparable` (which implies `Equatable`),
and `IntegerLiteralConvertible` (`BinaryFloatingPoint` includes conformance
to `FloatLiteralConvertible`).

```swift
/// A floating-point type that provides most of the IEEE 754 basic (clause 5)
/// operations.  The base, precision, and exponent range are not fixed in
/// any way by this protocol, but it enforces the basic requirements of
/// any IEEE 754 floating-point type.
///
/// The BinaryFloatingPoint protocol refines these requirements, adds some
/// additional operations that only make sense for a fixed radix, and also
/// provides default implementations of some of the FloatingPoint APIs.
public protocol FloatingPoint: Comparable, IntegerLiteralConvertible, SignedNumber {

  /// An integer type that can represent any written exponent.
  associatedtype Exponent: SignedInteger

  /// Initialize to zero
  init()

  /// Initialize from sign, exponent, and significand.
  ///
  /// The result is:
  ///
  /// ~~~
  /// (sign == .Minus ? -1 : 1) * significand * radix**exponent
  /// ~~~
  ///
  /// (where `**` is exponentiation) computed as if by a single correctly-
  /// rounded floating-point operation.  If this value is outside the
  /// representable range of the type, overflow or underflow occurs, and zero,
  /// a subnormal value, or infinity may result, as with any basic operation.
  /// Other edge cases:
  ///
  /// - If `significand` is zero or infinite, the result is zero or infinite,
  ///   regardless of the value of `exponent`.
  ///
  /// - If `significand` is NaN, the result is NaN.
  ///
  /// Note that for any floating-point `x` the result of
  ///
  ///   `Self(sign: x.sign,
  ///         exponent: x.exponent,
  ///         significand: x.significand)`
  ///
  /// is "the same" as `x`; it is `x` canonicalized.
  ///
  /// This initializer implements the IEEE 754 `scaleB` operation.
  init(sign: Sign, exponent: Exponent, significand: Self)

  /// A floating point value whose exponent and signficand are taken from
  /// `magnitude` and whose sign is taken from `signOf`.  Implements the

  // NOTE: Rationale for "ulp" instead of "epsilon":
  // We do not use that name because it is ambiguous at best and misleading
  // at worst:
  //
  // - Historically several definitions of "machine epsilon" have commonly

  //   "ulp" is a term with a specific unambiguous definition.
  //
  // - Some languages have used "epsilon" to refer to wildly different values,
  //   such as `leastNonzeroMagnitude`.
  //
  // - Inexperienced users often believe that "epsilon" should be used as a
  //   tolerance for floating-point comparisons, because of the name.  It is
  //   nearly always the wrong value to use for this purpose.

The `BinaryFloatingPoint` protocol provides a number of additional APIs
that only make sense for types with fixed radix 2:

`Float`, `Double`, `Float80` and `CGFloat` conform to both of these protocols.

Additionally, an initializer will be added to each of those types to construct
a NaN with specified payload:

```swift
  /// NaN with specified `payload`.
  ///
  /// Compares not equal to every value, including itself.  Most operations
  /// with a NaN operand will produce a NaN result.
  init(nan payload: Self.RawSignificand, signaling: Bool)
```

This initializer is not attached to either of the protocols because it may not
actually make sense or have consistent behavior for all possible types
conforming to the protocols.

## Impact on existing code

1. The `%` operator is no longer available for FloatingPoint types.  We don't
believe that it was widely used correctly, and the operation is still available
via the `formTruncatingRemainder` method for people who need it.

2. To follow the naming guidelines, `NaN` and `isNaN` are replaced with `nan`
and `isNaN`.

3. The redundant property `quietNaN` is removed.

4. `isSignaling` is renamed `isSignalingNaN`.

## Changes from the draft proposal

1. Removed the `Arithmetic` protocol; it may be circulated again in the future
as an independent proposal, or as part of a new model for integers.

2. Removed the `add[ing]`, `subtract[ing]`, etc methods, which were hooks for
`Arithmetic`.  This proposal now includes only the existing operator forms.

3. Removed static `nan(payload: signaling:)` method from protocols.  This will
exist as an initializer on concrete types, but not be part of the protocol.

4. Added the static `signalingNaN` property to the protocol to make up for #3.

5. Added the static `pi` property in response to popular demand.

6. Renamed the static `ulp` property `ulpOfOne` to avoid ambiguity with the
member property `ulp`.

7. Renamed `totalOrder` to `isTotallyOrdered` to be consistent with the other
comparison methods.

8. Additional clarifications and comments.

## Changes from revision 1

1. Reinstated `add`, `subtract`, etc from the draft of `Arithmetic` as methods
on `FloatingPoint`.  Operators moved out of protocol, mapped to method hooks.

2. Moved the associated type `RawSignificand` from `FloatingPoint` to the
`BinaryFloatingPoint` protocol.

3. Additional documentation added to some operations.

4. `leastMagnitude` --> `leastNonzeroMagnitude`.

5. Removed `isUnordered(with:)`, renamed `isTotallyOrdered(with:)` argument
label to `below:`.

6. `Nan` --> `NaN`; `nan` stays the same, as suggested by Jordan Rose.

7. `isLessThanOrEqual(to:)` --> `isLessThanOrEqualTo(_:)`.  I'm still not
totally convinced that this is an improvement, so I'd love to hear further
suggestions on how to handle this case.

8. Added associated types `Exponent` and `RawExponent` to allow for soft-float
types with stupendously large range.

9. Fixed (some) typos.

## Implementation status

Everything that does not depend on [SE-0104](0104-improved-integers.md) is implemented.  Some related operations were added in [SE-0113](0113-rounding-functions-on-floatingpoint.md).
