## Introduction

This proposal suggests a new initializer for `Array` and `ContiguousArray`
that provides access to an array's uninitialized storage buffer.

Swift-evolution thread: [https://forums.swift.org/t/array-initializer-with-access-to-uninitialized-buffer/13689](https://forums.swift.org/t/array-initializer-with-access-to-uninitialized-buffer/13689)

## Motivation

Some collection operations require working on a fixed-size buffer of uninitialized memory.
For example, one O(*n*) algorithm for performing a stable partition of an array is as follows:

1. Create a new array the same size as the original array.
2. Iterate over the original array,
   copying matching elements to the beginning of the new array
   and non-matching elements to the end.
3. When finished iterating, reverse the slice of non-matching elements.

Unfortunately, the standard library provides no way to create an array of a
particular size without initializing every element. Even if we
avoid initialization by manually allocating the memory using an
`UnsafeMutableBufferPointer`, there's no way to convert that buffer into an
array without copying the contents. There simply isn't a way to implement this
particular algorithm with maximum efficiency in Swift.

We also see this limitation when working with C APIs that fill a buffer with an
unknown number of elements and return the count. The workarounds are the same
as above: either initialize an array before passing it or copy the elements
from an unsafe mutable buffer into an array after calling.

## Proposed solution

Add a new `Array` initializer that lets a program work with an uninitialized
buffer.

The new initializer takes a closure that operates on an
`UnsafeMutableBufferPointer` and an `inout` count of initialized elements. This
closure has access to the uninitialized contents of the newly created array's
storage, and must set the initialized count of the array before exiting.

```swift
var myArray = Array<Int>(unsafeUninitializedCapacity: 10) { buffer, initializedCount in
    for x in 1..<5 {
        buffer[x] = x
    }
    buffer[0] = 10
    initializedCount = 5
}
// myArray == [10, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

With this new initializer, it's possible to implement the stable partition
as an extension to the `Collection` protocol, without any unnecessary copies:

```swift
func stablyPartitioned(by belongsInFirstPartition: (Element) throws -> Bool) rethrows -> [Element] {
    return try Array<Element>(unsafeUninitializedCapacity: count) { 
        buffer, initializedCount in
        var low = buffer.baseAddress!
        var high = low + buffer.count
        do {
            for element in self {
                if try belongsInFirstPartition(element) {
                    low.initialize(to: element)
                    low += 1
                } else {
                    high -= 1
                    high.initialize(to: element)
                }
            }
            
            let highIndex = high - buffer.baseAddress!
            buffer[highIndex...].reverse()
            initializedCount = buffer.count
        } catch {
            let lowCount = low - buffer.baseAddress!
            let highCount = (buffer.baseAddress! + buffer.count) - high
            buffer.baseAddress!.deinitialize(count: lowCount)
            high.deinitialize(count: highCount)
            throw error
        }
    }
}
```

This also facilitates efficient interfacing with C functions. For example,
suppose you wanted to wrap the function `vDSP_vsadd` in a Swift function that
returns the result as an array. This function requires you give it an unsafe
buffer into which it writes results. This is easy to do with an array, but you
would have to initialize the array with zeroes first. With a function like
`vDSP_vsadd`, this unnecessary zeroing out would eat into the slight speed edge
that the function gives you, defeating the point. This can be neatly solved
by using the proposed initializer:

```swift
extension Array where Element == Float {
    func dspAdd(scalar: Float) -> [Float] {
        let n = self.count
        return self.withUnsafeBufferPointer { buf in
            var scalar = scalar
            return Array<Float>(unsafeUninitializedCapacity: n) { rbuf, count in
                vDSP_vsadd(buf.baseAddress!, 1, &scalar, rbuf.baseAddress!, 1, UInt(n))
                count = n
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Detailed design

The new initializer is added to both `Array` and `ContiguousArray`.

```swift
/// Creates an array with the specified capacity, then calls the given closure
/// with a buffer covering the array's uninitialized memory.
///
/// The closure must set its second parameter to a number `c`, the number 
/// of elements that are initialized. The memory in the range `buffer[0..<c]`  
/// must be initialized at the end of the closure's execution, and the memory 
/// in the range `buffer[c...]` must be uninitialized. This postcondition
/// must hold even if the `initializer` closure throws an error.
///
/// - Note: While the resulting array may have a capacity larger than the
///   requested amount, the buffer passed to the closure will cover exactly
///   the requested number of elements.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - unsafeUninitializedCapacity: The number of elements to allocate space
///     for in the new array.
///   - initializer: A closure that initializes elements and sets the count of
///     the new array.
///     - Parameters:
///       - buffer: A buffer covering uninitialized memory with room
///         for the specified number of elements.
///       - initializedCount: The count of the array's initialized elements.
///         After initializing any elements inside `initializer`, update 
///         `initializedCount` with the new count for the array.
public init(
    unsafeUninitializedCapacity: Int,
    initializingWith initializer: (
        _ buffer: inout UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Element>,
        _ initializedCount: inout Int
    ) throws -> Void
) rethrows
```

### Specifying a capacity

The initializer takes the specific capacity that a user wants to work with as a
parameter. The buffer passed to the closure has a count that is exactly the
same as the specified capacity, even if the ultimate capacity of the new array is larger.

### Guarantees after throwing

If the closure parameter to the initializer throws, the `initializedCount`
value at the time an error is thrown is assumed to be correct. This means that
a user who needs to throw from inside the closure has one of two options.
Before throwing, they must:

1. deinitialize any newly initialized instances, or
2. update `initializedCount` to the correct count.

In either case, the postconditions that `buffer[0..<initializedCount]` are
initialized and `buffer[initializedCount...]` are deinitialized still hold.

### Naming considerations

The argument labels on the initializer are definitely a little on the long
side!

There are two important details of this API that led to the proposed spelling.
First, the initializer is *unsafe*, in that the user must be sure to properly
manage the memory addressed by the closure's buffer pointer parameter. Second,
the initializer provides access to the array's *uninitialized* storage, unlike
the other `Array.withUnsafe...` methods that already exist. Because trailing
closures are commonly used, it's important to include those terms in the
initial argument label, such that they're always visible at the use site.

#### Unused terminology

This proposal leaves out wording that would reference two other relevant concepts:

- *reserving capacity*: Arrays currently have a `reserveCapacity(_:)` method,
  which is somewhat akin to the first step of the initializer. However, that
  method is used for the sake of optimizing performance when adding to an
  array, rather than providing direct access to the array's capacity. In fact,
  as part of the `RangeReplaceableCollection` protocol, that method doesn't
  even require any action to be taken by the targeted type. For those reasons,
  the idea of "reserving" capacity doesn't seem as appropriate as providing a
  specific capacity that will be used.

- *unmanaged*: The proposed initializer is unusual in that it converts the lifetime management
  of manually initialized instances to be automatically managed, as elements of
  an `Array` instance. The only other type that performs this kind of
  conversion is `Unmanaged`, which is primarily used at the border of Swift and
  C interoperability, particularly with Core Foundation. Additionally,
  `Unmanaged` can be used to maintain and manage the lifetime of an instance
  over a long period of time, while this initializer performs the conversion as
  soon as the closure executes. As above, this term doesn't seem appropriate
  for use with this new API.


## Source compatibility

This is an additive change to the standard library,
so there is no effect on source compatibility.

## Effect on ABI stability

These initializers will need to be gated by OS versions on platforms that ship
the standard library in the OS.

## Effect on API resilience

The additional APIs will be a permanent part of the standard library,
and will need to remain public API. 

## Alternatives considered

### Returning the new count from the initializer closure

An earlier proposal included a method that allowed for access to the
uninitialized spare capacity of an array that also contained initialized
elements. Handling cases where the passed-in closure throws when there are
existing initialized elements is more complicated than in the initializer case,
and the proposal was returned for revision. Given the utilility and need
of the initializer part of the proposal is far greater, these two proposals
are being split out to unblock progress on that.

An earlier proposal had the initializer's closure return the new count, instead
of using an `inout` parameter. This proposal uses the parameter instead, so
that the method and initializer use the same closure type.

In addition, the throwing behavior described above requires that the
initialized count be set as an `inout` parameter instead of as a return value.
Not every `Element` type can be trivially initialized, so a user that
deinitializes some elements and then needs to throw an error would be stuck.
(This is only an issue with the mutating method.) Removing the `throws`
capability from the closure would solve this problem and simplify the new APIs'
semantics, but would be inconsistent with the other APIs in this space and
would make them more difficult to use as building blocks for higher-level
operations like `stablyPartitioned(by:)`.

### Creating an array from a buffer

An `Array` initializer that simply converts an `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer`
into an array's backing storage seems like it would be another solution.
However, an array's storage includes information
about the count and capacity at the beginning of its buffer,
so an `UnsafeMutableBufferPointer` created from scratch isn't usable.

## Addendum

You can Try This At Home™ with this extension, which provides the semantics
(but not the copy-avoiding performance benefits) of the proposed additions:

```swift
extension Array {
    public init(
        unsafeUninitializedCapacity: Int,
        initializingWith initializer: (
            _ buffer: inout UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Element>,
            _ initializedCount: inout Int
        ) throws -> Void
    ) rethrows {
        var buffer = UnsafeMutableBufferPointer<Element>
            .allocate(capacity: unsafeUninitializedCapacity)
        defer { buffer.deallocate() }
        
        var count = 0
        do {
            try initializer(&buffer, &count)
        } catch {
            buffer.baseAddress!.deinitialize(count: count)
            throw error
        }
        self = Array(buffer[0..<count])
    }
}
```
